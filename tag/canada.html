                <div class="summary"><p>The Great divide route changed this year with a new route to avoid a
long part of Highway. We heard from the racers that it was even harder
then they thought. I was really willing to do it, so we split and I went
on my own to the Flathead valley in Canada, just after Sparwoods. The
valley is really wild. You can see the difference and feel that there is
nothing close to you. Just bears, moose, deer&#8230;<br />
When I left Simon <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Ollie, it felt a bit strange to be on my own and to
bike into this wild <span class="amp">&amp;</span> remote spot&#8230; After a few heavy rain showers I
found a cabin (Butts cabin) where I could crash for the night, warming
up with the stove and drying the wet stuff from the previous camping
night. It was a good start!<br />
Later during the evening it started to rain again, and it kept raining
until 4.30am when I woke up&#8230;. grrrr&#8230; I had a hard time to get out my
sleeping bag! But by 6.30am I was out, in the rain and ...</p>

will get rid of. I was almost gonna send my big Canon camera but it was
too hard and I will carry it in my backpack instead. We also put the
flags on :-)<br />
At the post office, we sent a box of 3.9kg! The trailers felt so much
more easier to tow. Definitively it makes a big change! After some pasta
in Canmore it was time to head to the trail to get to Banff to get some
taste of the off-road of the Great Divide. We climbed up the Spray Lakes
road and Simon had a kind of disfunctional cycling problem&#8230; no more
energy in the legs! So he also trained to push the bike <span class="amp">&amp;</span> trailer
wearing his bike shoes&#8230; But he didn&#8217;t complain. He was mad at himself
to not having any energy in his body.<br />&nbsp;![IMG_2660_1][]![IMG_2662_1][]</p>
<p>After the climb comes the downhill (or almost should I say) to Banff on
the Goat Creek trail. It was a nice feeling to be i nthe forest biking
with the trailer ...</p>

10am at <span class="caps">MEC</span> to hopefully get the trailers. We were crossing our fingers,
and finally they were here! We unpack everything right in front of the
main door and assembled them in half an hour. Then we had to get back
home to send 43kg of gears down to Phoenix before being able to leave.
But yeah, there it started&#8230; Putting the trailer on the back of the
bike was quite&#8230;. how to say&#8230; surprising! It&#8217;s heavy!!! It&#8217;s really
heavy&#8230; How are we gonna do it. But let&#8217;s give it a try for the first
day to Canmore on a paved&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>We left Crystal <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Shannon who hosted us during almost one week (thank
you so much for your hospitality and all the good time <span class="amp">&amp;</span> parties we
had!) and started cycling toward Canmore on the 1A. About an hour later
we got a huge rain with thunders&#8230;<br />

ride somewhere ;-) Thanks but we have to go through this rain and to

to being back on a bike. Marco has been a very patient teacher, helping
me out with my biking skills. I&#8217;ve fallen off every day, but yesterday&#8217;s
was the worst so far. I approached a small steep hill in the forest, but
didn&#8217;t have enough speed to get up it, hit a root with the front wheel
and fell backwards and to the right back down off the hill. I landed on
a solid wooden wall, with my ribs taking most of the impact. I even
managed to dent the new bike - what an idiot! I managed to continue
riding, but with some discomfort, and this morning, I&#8217;m not doing too&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Other than that, preparations are going pretty well. We had our first
team teleconference yesterday morning, and all sounds well in Scotland,
where Ollie is getting ready to fly out on&nbsp;Thursday.</p>

shop so that we can pack them up and get all our ...</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Last night, Marco and I attended the Tour Divide pre-race barbeque in
Banff. It was a great opportunity to meet some of the riders, especially
the race organiser, Matthew. He invited us to join after reading about
our adventure on this site, and even gave us a <span class="caps">SPOT</span> tracking device.
This device will allow you to track our progress throughout our ride.
More details will follow - we&#8217;re still getting it all set up&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<p>This morning, we went along to see the riders set off on the trail, and
it was inspirational to say the least. Possibly the most striking thing
was how little equipment the racers were all taking with them. There
were a few panniers in sight, but definitely no trailers as all the
riders try to take as little as possible with them. This means that they
rely on making it to towns to spend the night in hotels or motels,
removing the need for a tent, sleeping bag, stove and fuel. You can
follow the race via theÂ <a href="http://tourdivide.org">Tour Divide</a> web&nbsp;site.</p>

<p>Simon bought his bike today! So we are almost set, just missing the
trailers which are supposed to come on Monday. We also bought a lot of
different things to have some spare parts for the bikes, clothes,
accessories for the bikes. It was a full day for Simon <span class="caps">VISA</span> card who
paid everything&nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>Simon also discovered the pros <span class="amp">&amp;</span> cons of using cleats as everyone does
on the first ride&#8230; But the bike doesn&#8217;t have any scratch, neither&nbsp;Simon!</p>
<p>Simon will be riding a Specialized Stumpjumper Aloy Hardtail M5.<br />
I will be riding an Orbea Alma Team&nbsp;Carbon.</p>

in Canada to start this adventure. It wasn&#8217;t as cold as I was thinking
and today is again a sunny&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>The initial status is like this: 2 men, 1 bike, 0 trailer - so it could
be better but at least it&#8217;s starting somewhere. We will look today for
Simon&#8217;s bike again and the trailers will come beginning of next week
since <span class="caps">MEC</span> messed up with our&nbsp;order.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I mounted my bike :-) A pleasure to see it! Pictures
will come later after today&#8217;s&nbsp;ride.</p>
