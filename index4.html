10am at <span class="caps">MEC</span> to hopefully get the trailers. We were crossing our fingers,
and finally they were here! We unpack everything right in front of the
main door and assembled them in half an hour. Then we had to get back
home to send 43kg of gears down to Phoenix before being able to leave.
But yeah, there it started&#8230; Putting the trailer on the back of the
bike was quite&#8230;. how to say&#8230; surprising! It&#8217;s heavy!!! It&#8217;s really
heavy&#8230; How are we gonna do it. But let&#8217;s give it a try for the first
day to Canmore on a paved&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>We left Crystal <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Shannon who hosted us during almost one week (thank
you so much for your hospitality and all the good time <span class="amp">&amp;</span> parties we
had!) and started cycling toward Canmore on the 1A. About an hour later
we got a huge rain with thunders&#8230;<br />

ride somewhere ;-) Thanks but we have to go through this rain and to

                <div class="summary"><p>Well, the trailers arrived at 10am today and Marco and I spent a little
time in the store assembling them and fixing them on to our bikes. After
shipping a huge box filled with all our other stuff to Phoenix, we set
off on the road to&nbsp;Canmore.</p>
<p>The road out of Calgary was busy and largely uphill and just as we
reached the steepest of the hills, a lightning storm passed over our
heads. Marco was up ahead as the lightning fork hit the ground - it
looked to be very close and the telephone wires crossing the road were
sparking. Then came a heavy rainfall, accompanied by a strong cold
headwind which soaked us through to the skin. This was definitely a good
test of the waterproof trailer bags, and thankfully they&nbsp;passed.</p>
<p>We had one huge downhill along the way and a series of long slow drags
up hills. The scenery was amazing though, and every mile brought the
mountains closer. We had another rain shower hut then the skies cleared
and we had a very sunny ride into Canmore, where we ...</p>

to being back on a bike. Marco has been a very patient teacher, helping
me out with my biking skills. I&#8217;ve fallen off every day, but yesterday&#8217;s
was the worst so far. I approached a small steep hill in the forest, but
didn&#8217;t have enough speed to get up it, hit a root with the front wheel
and fell backwards and to the right back down off the hill. I landed on
a solid wooden wall, with my ribs taking most of the impact. I even
managed to dent the new bike - what an idiot! I managed to continue
riding, but with some discomfort, and this morning, I&#8217;m not doing too&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Other than that, preparations are going pretty well. We had our first
team teleconference yesterday morning, and all sounds well in Scotland,
where Ollie is getting ready to fly out on&nbsp;Thursday.</p>

shop so that we can pack them up and get all our ...</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Last night, Marco and I attended the Tour Divide pre-race barbeque in
Banff. It was a great opportunity to meet some of the riders, especially
the race organiser, Matthew. He invited us to join after reading about
our adventure on this site, and even gave us a <span class="caps">SPOT</span> tracking device.
This device will allow you to track our progress throughout our ride.
More details will follow - we&#8217;re still getting it all set up&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<p>This morning, we went along to see the riders set off on the trail, and
it was inspirational to say the least. Possibly the most striking thing
was how little equipment the racers were all taking with them. There
were a few panniers in sight, but definitely no trailers as all the
riders try to take as little as possible with them. This means that they
rely on making it to towns to spend the night in hotels or motels,
removing the need for a tent, sleeping bag, stove and fuel. You can
follow the race via the <a href="http://tourdivide.org">Tour Divide</a> web&nbsp;site.</p>

<p>Simon bought his bike today! So we are almost set, just missing the
trailers which are supposed to come on Monday. We also bought a lot of
different things to have some spare parts for the bikes, clothes,
accessories for the bikes. It was a full day for Simon <span class="caps">VISA</span> card who
paid everything&nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>Simon also discovered the pros <span class="amp">&amp;</span> cons of using cleats as everyone does
on the first ride&#8230; But the bike doesn&#8217;t have any scratch, neither&nbsp;Simon!</p>
<p>Simon will be riding a Specialized Stumpjumper Aloy Hardtail M5.<br />
I will be riding an Orbea Alma Team&nbsp;Carbon.</p>

be better but at least it&#8217;s starting somewhere. We will look today for

before Ollie flies in from Scotland and we set&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still in New Zealand, hanging around in Auckland and trying to sell
the van, but things are starting to happen with logistics and we are
finalising more and more details almost every&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>The maps and guide book have arrived in here and I have now started to
study the route in more detail. I&#8217;d thought that this would make the
ride seem longer, but seeing the route on paper (over six maps)seems to
have made it more achievable in my mind. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s going
to be the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever attempted, but now it seems slightly
more possible. For those of you interested in the route, I&#8217;ve ...</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>We are still thinking what will be the right way to carry our load of
gears needed. We can see 3 possibilities.<br />
<img alt="bobgear-ibex" src="/images/2009/05/bobgear-ibex.jpg" title="bobgear-ibex" />The first one would be to have a trailer like the Bob
gear one, <a href="http://www.bobgear.com/trailers/trailer.php?product_id=11">Ibex trailer</a>, but it weights almost 8kg on its one. What
are the parts which are most likely to brake? How much can you load the
bag? Does it stay stable at high speed, is there a speed limit? What
about riding in the rain, mud? And last but not least, you need to think
about carrying it in the plane on the way back, if it&#8217;s worth to keep it
for another&nbsp;adventure&#8230;</p>
<p><img alt="ortlieb" src="/images/2009/05/ortlieb.jpg" title="ortlieb" /> The second alternative would racks on the side of the bike
with bags attached to them. Is it easy to ride on a mountain bike with
bags in the front and in the back of the bike? Is there any part of the
rack what might brake? How would you balance the weight between the
front and back bags? How does it feel on a bumpy downhill? Easy to ride
at high speed ...</p>

we&#8217;ll do our best to get to Antelope Wells inside the&nbsp;month.</p>
