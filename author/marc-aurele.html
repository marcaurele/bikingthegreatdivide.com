As far as I can remember from all the travels I&#8217;ve
done and experiences I had, this one goes in the top 5! When I&#8217;m looking
back where it started, it makes me smile and remember me how incredible
it is to travel and to meet&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>I liked this trail very much because it gave me a total different view
of the <span class="caps">USA</span> and the people living there. We went through small towns most
of the time, places where you wouldn&#8217;t go and visit if you were coming
from Europe for sure. I could appreciate how friendly and helpful the
people are. I know now why they have these big pick-up trucks: to pull
their huge trailer anywhere in the mountain. The food isn&#8217;t great and
it&#8217;s not going to change I think, we struggled to find pasta in
restaurants all the time. It&#8217;s really a burger <span class="amp">&amp;</span> food chains land, no
doubt! But the <span class="caps">USA</span> are big, huge, it&#8217;s a big sky country with amazing
landscapes, reason why I came back with more than 1300 photos ...</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>We are in Silver City, around 120 miles to go to Antelope Wells so we
will be done by tomorrow. It&#8217;s sad it&#8217;s so soon the end but at the same
time I&#8217;m happy to think I&#8217;ll be able to do something else than just
riding every day. I have to catch up with sonme many emails, and you&#8217;re
all waiting for the pictures which I never forgot to take every single
day! Even if I&#8217;m riding fast ;-) I&#8217;m taking pictures all the time so
they could catch up with me&nbsp;&#8230;</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Simon had to get a ride today to Albuquerque since he had different
problems with his bike. I don&#8217;t know the details since we weren&#8217;t biking
together (I was trying to make it to Pie town before 3pm to get some
food&#8230; which I did). So we will meet again in Silver City tomorrow
evening or the day&nbsp;after.</p>
<p>I found a new challenge for me, to make it to Silver City in one day&#8230;
180 miles and a few climbs of course. Stay tune on the live tracking to
see if I&#8217;ll make it or not ;-) I&#8217;ll start early tomorrow morning in the
dark with the food I have&nbsp;left&#8230;</p>
<p>The story of how I got the news about Simon in a town without any mobile
reception, is simply: the Spot device! Simon&#8217;s dad contacted different
people here to forward me the news when he spotted me in Pie town,
looking for the shops <span class="amp">&amp;</span> services next to where I was. I was really
starting to wonder where Simon&nbsp;was&#8230;</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Since I started the trip I mostly enjoyed every day without suffering
much compared to Simon (and Ollie for the time he spent with us). But
New-Mexico is something different! I left Simon who wanted to make a
shorter day for his calf muscle after Platoro and I biked all the way up
to La Manga Pass, arriving at the top before 9pm. I spent the night with
a family camping a mile out of the road who offered me beers, chicken,
hot-dogs&#8230; A dream night before what I can call my hardest&nbsp;days!</p>
<p>The day afte started with a turn I missed and ended up doing a few extra
miles and climbs for &#8220;free&#8221;&#8230; Then I had to push my bike a few hundred
meters for the first time.. grrr I was upset! And then, with the rough
road my bike computer reset itself twice in the middle of check points
on the map. It was such a bad day&#8230; I was so angry! And for the
happening of the day, I biked hard to make it to El Rito for the night ...</p>

to tell about two long days we had, one to get to Swan Lake, and the
next one to Seeley Creek.<br />
To Swan Lake, we arrived there around 9.30pm after a long day of lots
of up <span class="amp">&amp;</span> down all the time and a last long hill to climb. We thought
first to camp somewhere but couldn&#8217;t really find a spot and the
mosquitos were sooooo bad! No way! We ended up at the campground before
it got dark at least.<br />
The second day, we just made it before it was completely dark&#8230; We
left a bit too late Swan Lake and with the last hard climb before Seeley
Creek, we only arrived at 10.15pm there. Campground again, but no one
would serve us food, all kitchens were closed :-( So we had to cook our
&#8220;emergency pasta&#8221; on the ground, with our headlight and we were pretty
tired (some more than others of course, but all starving and sleepy).
This day we made almost ...</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>The Great divide route changed this year with a new route to avoid a
long part of Highway. We heard from the racers that it was even harder
then they thought. I was really willing to do it, so we split and I went
on my own to the Flathead valley in Canada, just after Sparwoods. The
valley is really wild. You can see the difference and feel that there is
nothing close to you. Just bears, moose, deer&#8230;<br />
When I left Simon <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Ollie, it felt a bit strange to be on my own and to
bike into this wild <span class="amp">&amp;</span> remote spot&#8230; After a few heavy rain showers I
found a cabin (Butts cabin) where I could crash for the night, warming
up with the stove and drying the wet stuff from the previous camping
night. It was a good start!<br />
Later during the evening it started to rain again, and it kept raining
until 4.30am when I woke up&#8230;. grrrr&#8230; I had a hard time to get out my
sleeping bag! But by 6.30am I was out, in the rain and ...</p>

will get rid of. I was almost gonna send my big Canon camera but it was
too hard and I will carry it in my backpack instead. We also put the
flags on :-)<br />
At the post office, we sent a box of 3.9kg! The trailers felt so much
more easier to tow. Definitively it makes a big change! After some pasta
in Canmore it was time to head to the trail to get to Banff to get some
taste of the off-road of the Great Divide. We climbed up the Spray Lakes
road and Simon had a kind of disfunctional cycling problem&#8230; no more
energy in the legs! So he also trained to push the bike <span class="amp">&amp;</span> trailer
wearing his bike shoes&#8230; But he didn&#8217;t complain. He was mad at himself
to not having any energy in his body.<br />&nbsp;![IMG_2660_1][]![IMG_2662_1][]</p>
<p>After the climb comes the downhill (or almost should I say) to Banff on
the Goat Creek trail. It was a nice feeling to be i nthe forest biking
with the trailer ...</p>

10am at <span class="caps">MEC</span> to hopefully get the trailers. We were crossing our fingers,
and finally they were here! We unpack everything right in front of the
main door and assembled them in half an hour. Then we had to get back
home to send 43kg of gears down to Phoenix before being able to leave.
But yeah, there it started&#8230; Putting the trailer on the back of the
bike was quite&#8230;. how to say&#8230; surprising! It&#8217;s heavy!!! It&#8217;s really
heavy&#8230; How are we gonna do it. But let&#8217;s give it a try for the first
day to Canmore on a paved&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>We left Crystal <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Shannon who hosted us during almost one week (thank
you so much for your hospitality and all the good time <span class="amp">&amp;</span> parties we
had!) and started cycling toward Canmore on the 1A. About an hour later
we got a huge rain with thunders&#8230;<br />

It was raining so much that someone stopped and asked if we needed a
ride somewhere ;-) Thanks but we have to go through this rain and to
Canmore on ...</p>

<p>Simon bought his bike today! So we are almost set, just missing the
trailers which are supposed to come on Monday. We also bought a lot of
different things to have some spare parts for the bikes, clothes,
accessories for the bikes. It was a full day for Simon <span class="caps">VISA</span> card who
paid everything&nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>Simon also discovered the pros <span class="amp">&amp;</span> cons of using cleats as everyone does
on the first ride&#8230; But the bike doesn&#8217;t have any scratch, neither&nbsp;Simon!</p>
<p>Simon will be riding a Specialized Stumpjumper Aloy Hardtail M5.<br />
I will be riding an Orbea Alma Team&nbsp;Carbon.</p>
