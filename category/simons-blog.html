Day Thirty Two – Just Past Cuba to Desert Camp– 65 miles – 2,398 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We were woken very early by the sound of several heavy lorries going
past, but slept in for a little while extra until the alarm went off. We
were eating breakfast when the lorries returned, each one brim full of
gravel, brought from a storage site further in to the&nbsp;desert.</p>
<p>This was a day I had been nervous about for a long while. The desert
roads are supposedly tricky to navigate through and are often too sandy
to ride along. If it rains, then the tracks become impassable, but if it
is too dry, then I knew that we were unlikely to come across a good
source of water until we reached Grants, some 110 miles&nbsp;away.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I set off along the sandy road a little ahead of Marco,
knowing that he would soon catch me anyway. I negotiated the first turn
and started to feel a little more confident about the map reading; the
roads looked <span class="caps">OK</span> too. That feeling soon disappeared as we approached ...</p></!--more-->

Day Twenty Nine – Horca to Hopewell Lake – 71 miles – 2,184 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Alan and I woke to a very cold and damp morning, but it was dry at
least. The good news was that my calf was feeling <span class="caps">OK</span>. A bag of ice from
the camp host certainly helped the healing the evening&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>We ate breakfast, packed and got back onto the trail, wondering if we
were going to a) make it to El Rito and b) ever see Marco&nbsp;again.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The trail took us further down the valley, alongside the
Conejos (Rabbits) River towards Horca. It was really cold and I couldn&#8217;t
find my warm gloves, meaning that my fingers were absolutely frozen by
the time we arrived at the local store, where the sun had finally
reached. We&#8217;d heard that we shouldn&#8217;t rely on the store in Horca; it is
run by an old woman who apparently has quite a flexible approach to
opening hours. As we were looking for a nice hot cup of coffee, the
store was&nbsp;closed!</p>

Day Twenty Two – Slater to Steamboat – 63 miles – 1,644 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We were up and about before sunrise and although it was pretty chilly,
it looked as though it was going to be a good day. We heated oatmeal and
drank tea before setting off towards the town of Steamboat. I had been
very disappointed about not making it as far as we&#8217;d hoped the day
before, but set off determined to ride better today; knowing that we
were only going to ride about 60 miles certainly helped. I hoped it
would feel like a rest day, which sounds a bit crazy, now I think about&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>The trail was a good one again and we were making pretty good time even
though it was uphill for most of the morning. Marco went on ahead and I
continued the climb on my own. The last mile and a half was very rocky
indeed and I had to push most of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t have the best night&#8217;s sleep – it was pretty warm in the tent
which didn&#8217;t help, I&#8217;m sure. We woke up and got packed away in time for
a fantastic breakfast – just what we both needed. I was feeling much
much better, even despite the poor night&#8217;s&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p>We got out onto the gravel road nice and early and the weather was
pretty good for us, a little cooler than the previous couple of days. I
felt like I was racing along, but Marco was still up ahead of me as we
crossed over the state border out of Idaho and into&nbsp;Wyoming.</p>
<p>The trail was in good condition until we started to climb up along the
edge of Yellowstone National Park. I kept my eyes out for bears, but
didn&#8217;t spot any, perhaps they were staying out of the way of the
mosquitoes that were swarming all around us and feasting on our&nbsp;flesh.</p>

<p>After a disturbingly short sleep, the alarm sounded and was promptly
silenced. I was exhausted and felt like I&#8217;d only just crawled into my
sleeping bag. Fortunately, Ollie and Marco both seemed to be a bit on
the slow side this morning, but wandered into town to get some
breakfast, leaving me in the tent to get myself&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>I managed to drag myself up and out and walked into Seeley Lake to try
and join the others for some breakfast. The place we&#8217;d agreed to meet
only served coffee, but the lady there was very friendly and told me
that she&#8217;d given Ollie and Marco a lift (a lift!!!) up the road to
somewhere serving a good breakfast. With her good turn for the day
already done, I received no offer of a ride and so had to slowly make my
way up the road to the diner.<br />

I didn&#8217;t sleep at all well and was tired when the alarm went off.
Still, we all got ourselves down to the kitchen in the Banff <span class="caps">YWCA</span> (where
we were staying) and ate a huge amount of cereal and&nbsp;yoghurt.</p>
<p>Ollie went into town to get his bike bag sent on to Phoenix and Marco
and I finished off sorting the bikes out, and Marco grabbed a few
minutes more&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p>After some last minute repairs to Ollie&#8217;s trailer, we finally set off
from the <span class="caps">YWCA</span> towards the start of the trail, just a couple of minutes
away. We were met by Robin and his family at the trailhead and they took
some photos of us looking nervous and excited as we set off on this epic
journey. I know that I had expended a lot of nervous energy in getting
to this point and as we pulled away from the car park, I let out a whoop
of excitement - very unlike&nbsp;me ...</p>

wonderfully well. We had slept under the stars in the desert, woke
before sunrise and were on our bikes as soon as it began to get light.
The air was cool (ish) and the trail was good, and although we were a
little bit sad that it was the last day of the ride, I think both Marco
and I were excited about reaching our goal; the Mexican border post of
Antelope&nbsp;Wells.</p>
<p>We still had about 80 miles to go, including the infamous (among Divide
riders) Lonely Highway; the seldom used road that covers the final 45
miles from Hachita to Antelope Wells.  Naturally, it is uphill (if only
very slightly) and of course we were riding into a headwind but the
hardest thing about the road was the complete lack of traffic; I counted
around 15 cars during those miles, and most of those were Border Patrol&nbsp;vehicles.</p>
<p>The silence gave me plenty of time to reflect on the trip overall. It
seems like light years ago since we left Banff, but at the same time,
