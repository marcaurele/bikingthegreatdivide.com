                <div class="summary"><p>I thought the road to Grants had been tough, but when Marco went on
ahead to Pie Town (we heard that the grocery store closed at 3pm and we
needed to stock up), I didn&#8217;t know that it would be so long until I saw
him&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>My day started well, the legs felt fairly fresh and I seemed to be
coping well with the climbing - a long steady uphill to make another
Continental Divide crossing. After a short section on the highway, I
turned into the West Malpais Wilderness, about which I had heard many
horror stories. The track was surprisingly good and the first 20 miles
passed very&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>With less than 10 miles to go to the highway, I got my first flat tyre.
I sat down at the side of the trail and got it fixed, had a bite to eat
and got back on my way. Less than 2 miles later, the bike was back
upside down as I had ripped a hole in the tyre. That, and the resulting
puncture fixed, I got back on my way ...</p>

hot,hot,hot! Marco and I had a very warm day yesterday, with
temperatures hitting 43 degrees in the afternoon, and with very little
water&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re now in Grants, heading for Pie Town, which marks the start of the
final map - we started out with seven in&nbsp;Banff.</p>
<p>The climbs should be lessening in size from now on, but that means that
it will just keep on getting hotter as we travel further south. We&#8217;ve
both had our moments of feeling that we won&#8217;t make it, but after
surviving the desert, I think we are both a lot more positive&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>More soon, hopefully from Pie Town&nbsp;tomorrow&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

pedalling hard (even on the downhills) just to keep some momentum, the
thought occurred to me that I&#8217;d much rather be at home watching the&nbsp;cricket!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a tough few days for me. After the highlight of completing our
first 100 mile day on the way to Lima, came the disastrous Day 13. We
should have known it was going to be a bad day, but still Ollie and I
both ordered Breakfast Number 13 from the menu at the local&nbsp;cafe.</p>
<p>The day started out well and we were making good progress until Ollie
stopped for a call of nature by the trailside and then never caught us
up. He had a massive puncture caused by a tear to the rim of his rear&nbsp;tyre.</p>
<p>I unhooked the trailer and headed back to find him and then we all
helped to change the patched tyre onto the front wheel, where it would
bear less&nbsp;weight.</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t improve much after that. We were getting slower and ...</p>

mainly to a late start and some problems with the bikes and&nbsp;trailers.</p>
<p>Day Two was much better, as we covered 66 miles on the way to Elkford,
but still behind the unofficial schedule we had set&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>Day Three was a bigger day for Ollie and I, as we covered 78 miles,
although some of this was on paved roads. Marco was off on a little side
trip adventure - check out his blog to find out&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Day Four was a really wet and cold day which took us over the border and
into Montana. We spent the night in Eureka, where we met back up with&nbsp;Marco.</p>
<p>Day Five was a tough day with two big long climbs, and even our first
sighting of snow on the trail, meaning that we only covered 68&nbsp;miles.</p>
<p>Day Six was our longest day of the trip; we covered 90+ miles on the way
from Upper Whitefish Lake to Swan Lake, where we spent an entertaining
evening with some locals in the ...</p>

lot of fun, we have made it to Whitefish, Montana. Ollie&#8217;s bike is
getting a bit of a makeover, so we have a few minutes to spend here in
the&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>What to say about the trip so far? It has been hard work - a couple of
huge killer hills yesterday but some wicked downhills too. Marco and
Ollie have both seen bears, I haven&#8217;t yet. We&#8217;ve seen plenty of deer and
a moose, loads of squirrels and chipmunks, and I accidentally ran over a
snake&nbsp;yesterday&#8230;..</p>
<p>The scenery has been unbelievable too - snow on the mountains and loads
of green hills and trees all around. So wonderful to be travelling
through this land. The view seems to keep on changing and I can&#8217;t wait
to get some pictures up here&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>Should be quite a flat (ish) day today, with one big climb towards this
evening, and then another hilly day&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>

The device is a little bit difficult to operate, but we hope to have it
working well as soon as we set off tomorrow morning. You can follow or

<p>We&#8217;ve also updated the &#8220;Charity&#8221; tab. We aren&#8217;t riding for one single

please just leave a comment or send us an email giving the name of the

time in the store assembling them and fixing them on to our bikes. After
shipping a huge box filled with all our other stuff to Phoenix, we set
off on the road to&nbsp;Canmore.</p>
<p>The road out of Calgary was busy and largely uphill and just as we
reached the steepest of the hills, a lightning storm passed over our
heads. Marco was up ahead as the lightning fork hit the ground - it
looked to be very close and the telephone wires crossing the road were
sparking. Then came a heavy rainfall, accompanied by a strong cold
headwind which soaked us through to the skin. This was definitely a good
test of the waterproof trailer bags, and thankfully they&nbsp;passed.</p>
<p>We had one huge downhill along the way and a series of long slow drags
up hills. The scenery was amazing though, and every mile brought the
mountains closer. We had another rain shower hut then the skies cleared
and we had a very sunny ride into Canmore, where we ...</p>

to being back on a bike. Marco has been a very patient teacher, helping
me out with my biking skills. I&#8217;ve fallen off every day, but yesterday&#8217;s
was the worst so far. I approached a small steep hill in the forest, but
didn&#8217;t have enough speed to get up it, hit a root with the front wheel
and fell backwards and to the right back down off the hill. I landed on
a solid wooden wall, with my ribs taking most of the impact. I even
managed to dent the new bike - what an idiot! I managed to continue
riding, but with some discomfort, and this morning, I&#8217;m not doing too&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Other than that, preparations are going pretty well. We had our first
team teleconference yesterday morning, and all sounds well in Scotland,

Banff. It was a great opportunity to meet some of the riders, especially
the race organiser, Matthew. He invited us to join after reading about
our adventure on this site, and even gave us a <span class="caps">SPOT</span> tracking device.
This device will allow you to track our progress throughout our ride.
More details will follow - we&#8217;re still getting it all set up&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<p>This morning, we went along to see the riders set off on the trail, and
it was inspirational to say the least. Possibly the most striking thing
was how little equipment the racers were all taking with them. There
were a few panniers in sight, but definitely no trailers as all the
riders try to take as little as possible with them. This means that they
rely on making it to towns to spend the night in hotels or motels,
removing the need for a tent, sleeping bag, stove and fuel. You can
follow the race via the <a href="http://tourdivide.org">Tour Divide</a> web&nbsp;site.</p>
