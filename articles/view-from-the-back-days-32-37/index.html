                <p><strong>July 20<br />
Day Thirty Two – Just Past Cuba to Desert Camp– 65 miles – 2,398 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We were woken very early by the sound of several heavy lorries going
past, but slept in for a little while extra until the alarm went off. We
were eating breakfast when the lorries returned, each one brim full of
gravel, brought from a storage site further in to the&nbsp;desert.</p>
<p>This was a day I had been nervous about for a long while. The desert
roads are supposedly tricky to navigate through and are often too sandy
to ride along. If it rains, then the tracks become impassable, but if it
is too dry, then I knew that we were unlikely to come across a good
source of water until we reached Grants, some 110 miles&nbsp;away.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I set off along the sandy road a little ahead of Marco,
knowing that he would soon catch me anyway. I negotiated the first turn
and started to feel a little more confident about the map reading; the
roads looked <span class="caps">OK</span> too. That feeling soon disappeared as we approached a
very sandy section. Marco powered through the first bit, but I was more
cautious (probably my main problem) and the sand quickly gripped my
front wheel and I battled to stay upright. Starting to ride whilst the
bike is sand-logged is particularly hard work and so I had to get off
and push. I began to think that we weren’t going to make it very far if
the tracks were like this all the way to&nbsp;Grants.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before I saw Marco riding back towards me – this was not
good news. He’d reached a locked gate across the trail; something that
wasn’t mentioned in the trail notes. We unhitched his trailer and lifted
it over the gate and he went on ahead to investigate. As far as we could
tell, we’d followed the route correctly this morning, but it had somehow
led us to a dead end, and the gravel store that the lorries had been
using this&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p>We pored over the map and tried to work out where we might have gone
wrong, but just ended up riding back the way we’d come, trying to find
the correct way. In the end, we found what we were looking for and got
back on the right track. It looked like the road the lorries had been
using had been recently built and as it was bigger and wider than the
original tracks, we had been misled into following it. We’d done an
extra six miles and spent a long time over them. I was now even more
nervous about the road&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the trail was pretty good and we started to make decent
progress again. The views were stunning; we were truly in the desert now
and it was like nothing I’d ever seen before. Huge volcanic plugs dotted
the horizon, joined by vast swathes of desert sand. It was truly&nbsp;breathtaking.</p>
<p>After a short downhill section along a paved road, we turned off and
headed towards one of the giant volcanic plugs. By now, the sun was
getting high in the sky and the temperature was rising. We stopped for a
bite to eat in the shade of a rare bush before setting off again. I was
beginning to feel very hot and tired and was worried about drinking too
much water as I knew that we would have to make our supplies last.
Progress was very slow and as the temperature hit 43 degrees Celsius, we
stopped for another break. I was feeling the effects of the sun and lay
down to try and get some sleep. It didn’t work; even though I was so
tired, I couldn’t get the sleep I needed. We checked the route
description and saw that there may be a good source of water six miles
ahead. That might not sound very far, but I knew that I would find it
very hard work getting&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>The terrain was basically flat but every so often we would descend
steeply into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arroyo_(creek)">arroyo</a> and then have to climb just as steeply out
the other side. Often the bottom of the arroyo would be pretty sandy,
making the six mile ride more like an obstacle&nbsp;course.</p>
<p>Finally, up ahead I saw that Marco had stopped and climbed over a barbed
wire fence next to a huge solar panel. As I came closer, he raised his
arms in the air and I knew that we had found the water source. The
Bureau of Land Management (<span class="caps">BLM</span>) maintain this area as some kind of
wildlife enclosure and the solar panel powers a water pump from a deep
well, giving a constant supply of water. I don’t know how many litres of
water we pumped, filtered and drank there, but it was like an oasis and
spirits were lifted. I think we were carrying enough water to get us
through, but this was like an extra bonus and gave us both more
confidence that we were going to make&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>On we rode, until we reached the boundary of private lands, upon which
we weren’t allowed to camp. As this land stretches for some twenty miles
or so, we had to make camp before crossing into this area; we weren’t
going to be able to ride another twenty miles that day as the sun was
already beginning to&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>We found a great spot to camp, with a huge rock overhang under which we
planned to sleep without our tents. We got some pasta on the go and
everything seemed well with the world again. It was awesome to watch the
sunset in the desert; the rocks that surrounded us constantly changed
colour as the sunlight&nbsp;reduced.</p>
<p>A storm was brewing in the distance and we watched as lightning bolts
shot down and hit the horizon. It looked as though it was going to miss
us, but as we were almost ready for bed, the rain started to fall. There
followed a mass panic to get the tents up; I nearly lost mine thanks to
a huge gust of wind, but we managed to get properly set up before the
wind and rain got too&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p><strong>July 21<br />
Day Thirty Three – Desert Camp to Just Past Grants – 72 miles – 2,470
miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Waking up in the desert was an absolute delight. As the sun came up, we
were treated to a light show similar to the sunset the night&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>After breakfast, we headed off once again under thankfully cloudy skies.
The rain last night hadn’t amounted to much and so the tracks were still
in good condition and even though we were climbing gently, the riding
seemed a lot easier than the previous&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We did however manage to make another wrong turn and ended up riding
straight into a yard outside a farmstead. The farmer didn’t seem too
impressed with us, but pointed us back in the right direction and we
soon found the correct track without making too much of a&nbsp;detour.</p>
<p>We reached a paved section, Marco went on ahead and I plodded up the
hill behind him. We had learned from Alan that this particular four mile
section was supposed to have become private land and that we weren’t
supposed to be riding along it. For that reason, the advice from the
Adventure Cycling Association was to take the paved alternative route
between Cuba and Grants. Well, as tough as it had been, I wouldn’t have
wanted to miss my chance to ride that section through the desert. There
were no signs along the road to suggest that we shouldn’t be there, and
there seemed like a reasonable flow of traffic along there&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Turning off the road, there was more climbing ahead as we crossed the
foothills of the San Mateo mountain range. Part way up the hill, I
realised that I was now carrying way too much water than I needed and so
emptied a couple of my bottles by the side of the trail. The cloud cover
meant that the temperature was much less of a problem than the previous
day and with my reduced load, I made steady progress up the&nbsp;hill.</p>
<p>I stopped for a bite to eat near the top of the climb and began looking
forward to the descent into Grants. I would have to wait a while though,
as the downhill never seemed to get started. The course descriptions
were slightly misleading and the track was particularly gravelly making
for slow progress. When the downhill finally started though, it was well
worth the&nbsp;wait.</p>
<p>I stopped to take a photo next to the Grants prison – a sign by the side
of the road reminded drivers not to pick up hitch hikers there –
brilliant! I was very happy to make it into the town of Grants; we had
survived the desert, another major milestone reached on our journey to&nbsp;Mexico.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon in Grants, getting our laundry done (very badly),
eating some spicy Mexican food and getting online. For once we were in a
town with a library during opening hours and so we looked forward to
getting some blogging and email done. Unfortunately, the library’s
computers were out of action that day as they were being upgraded! Any
other day and we would have been fine! We found a place to get online
close by and got back in touch with the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>After a dinner in Pizza Hut, we set off again, this time along a short
section of Route 66 – it was great to be riding a section of this famous
road. Before long, we were off the road again and starting to climb up
through a big canyon where there seemed to be more traffic than there
had been on the highway! We stopped before the sunset and set up our
camp for the night, leaving our still slightly damp clothes hanging on
the bikes to&nbsp;dry.</p>
<p><strong>July 22<br />
Day Thirty Four – Just Past Grants to Las Lunas – 90 miles – 2,560 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Neither of us could have guessed how today was to turn out when we set
off before the sun was up. It was to be a day of fast riding, crushing
disappointment, huge amounts of luck and international&nbsp;communication.</p>
<p>Our destination that day was Pie Town; a small settlement some 75 miles
away. We’d heard from Ollie that although we could get food there, the
shop closed early in the day, around 3pm. We would need to get some
supplies for the following couple of days and so we decided to split up
for the day’s ride. Marco went on ahead so that at least he would make
it before the shop closed. I thought I could make it in time, but wasn’t
sure how the terrain would affect my&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>As he disappeared up the hill into the distance, I had a slightly funny
feeling that something was going to happen that day. I couldn’t have
guessed what&nbsp;though….</p>
<p>I was riding well and felt very comfortable as the track took us up and
over the Continental Divide for the 19^th^ and then 20^th^ times on the
trip. Around every corner I expected the trail to deteriorate, but it
was in really great shape and I was making great time. I started to
think ahead and realised that as long as I continued like this, I would
easily make it to Pie Town before 3pm. And maybe it was that thinking
ahead that got me in to&nbsp;trouble.</p>
<p>I had just crested a small rise when I suddenly felt something was wrong
with the front wheel. It felt as though the tyre was stuck in the sand
again, but when I looked down I saw that it was just a flat. Never mind,
it was to be expected here in New Mexico as the thorns here are well
known for stopping bikers in their&nbsp;tracks.</p>
<p>I stopped and got the flat changed quickly and sat down for a quick bite
to eat. I set off again but within ten minutes I was stopped by the side
of the trail with the front wheel off again. Two more holes had appeared
in the new tyre and so it had to be changed again. Luckily, I had two
spares and so I didn’t need to fix the punctures each time, although I
knew that if it happened again I would have to find and fix the&nbsp;holes.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the tyre to go again and this time I had to get
the repair kit out and fix the holes. Again, I had two holes in this
tyre, making five flats in as many miles. Things were not looking too&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>I had just reached the highway when my back tyre also gave out. This
time it was really serious. My back wheel had not been completely
straight for a few days and it badly needed a visit to a bike shop to
get fixed or replaced. As soon as I took the wheel off, there was a loud
“<span class="caps">TWANG</span>!” sound as the wheel buckled even more, pinging off three spokes
in the process. I knew then that I was in big&nbsp;trouble.</p>
<p>I fixed the flat and tried to get the back wheel back on, but it was so
bent out of shape that it wouldn’t go round properly without rubbing on
the frame. I tried to ride on, but it was utterly hopeless. I must have
looked like a clown on that bent wheel, but I wasn’t laughing. I sat at
the side of the road thinking that this was a horrible way for the trip
to end. I knew there wasn’t a bike shop for many, many miles and I had
no hope of riding there&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>So, this was it for me. I’d come so far but it looked like this was it.
In a way I was a bit relieved, but that relief didn’t last very long.
There was no way I was going to quit now. I had to hope that someone
would come and rescue me. And amazingly, they&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>Duran and Cindi are two waste management executives from Tuscon Arizona,
who just happened to be on their way to Albuquerque, where I knew there
would be at least a couple of bike shops. The problem was that
Albuquerque was a long way away, and not in the direction I needed to&nbsp;travel.</p>
<p>As we drove on, it turned out that they often drove up to Albuquerque,
but this was the first time they’d tried this way; they usually opted
for the quicker interstate highways. I was very lucky indeed. They were
very interested in my story and when they got mobile phone reception, I
became the subject of their telephone calls too –&nbsp;hilarious!</p>
<p>They dropped me right outside the bike shop and I handed my battered
bike (now with another flat tyre!) over to the guys in the shop. My next
job was to try and get hold of Marco and let him know what was going on.
I had mobile signal, but Marco was in the middle of nowhere and had no
signal. I left a message anyway and then looked at my map to try and get
a number for the shop in Pie Town, where I hoped to leave a message for
him. No such luck; my map gave no useful numbers – what could I do? I
did the only thing I could think of, and called my mum and&nbsp;dad!</p>
<p>It was almost midnight at home, but Dad accepted the challenge of
finding some contact details for anyone in Pie Town. I’m not sure quite
how he did it, but Marco ended up getting three separate messages
telling him what had happened! He was the most famous person in Pie Town
for a short while I&nbsp;think!!</p>
<p>I bought myself a map of New Mexico as I was way, way, way off of the
route maps, and tried to figure out a way to ride myself back towards
the route. I thought that I would have two days to make it to Silver
City, some 230 miles away, but from the map it was clear that I was
going to have to do a huge proportion of this on the interstate highway,
which wasn’t too&nbsp;appealing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, once the bike was fixed, complete with thorn-proof inner
tubes, I hit the road and started heading south. The traffic was
horrendous and it was a good while before it thinned out and I started
to feel a little safer. There was no shoulder and the rush hour was in
full swing, but I knew that I needed to get some more miles done before
it got&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>As darkness began to fall, I rode into Las Lunas, where I found myself a
motel room for the night. It was here that I looked at myself in the
mirror and was a little bit shocked at the state I was in. Not only had
I lost quite a bit of weight, but I was filthy from head to toe and I
looked&nbsp;exhausted.</p>
<p>I took a long shower and sat eating my food supplies whilst watching
some Tour de France highlights. I also gave my bike a good clean; it too
was in a pretty filthy state. I got another text message from Dad just
before I fell asleep; Marco was planning to make it to Silver City the
next day – that meant that I had the best part of 200 miles to ride if I
was going to catch him. Even on the road, I knew this wasn’t going to be
possible, so I readied myself for the prospect of some&nbsp;hitching.</p>
<p><strong>July 23<br />
Day Thirty Five – Las Lunas to Silver City – 110 miles – 2,670 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>I was exhausted but despite the comfy bed, I didn’t sleep very well at
all. I was up way before it was light, packed all my stuff back up and
filled up on cereal, bananas and pastries from the motel buffet&nbsp;breakfast.</p>
<p>It was just about light when I set out from the motel. I tried to check
if there was a bus that could take me part of the way, but I had no luck
and so I hit the highway, looking to ride as far as I could before it
got too&nbsp;hot.</p>
<p>The shoulder along the highway was wide, but it was covered in rubbish
from the road – bits of shredded tyres and broken glass littered the way
ahead. I’d gone about fifty miles before I got really hot and tired and
decided to try my hand at hitching a&nbsp;lift.</p>
<p>It didn’t go too well to start off with. The traffic seemed to have
thinned out after the last intersection and nobody seemed interested in
stopping to pick me up. I was just about to give up, when a pickup
stopped just ahead of me. I ran up to it and the guys told me they could
take me about fifty miles on to the town of Truth or Consequences. I was
over the moon – fifty miles in a van would save me loads of time and so
I packed myself and the bike into the back and off we went. The only
down side of this ride was that the driver told me that the route from
Truth or Consequences to Silver City would take me uphill for around 17
miles up over a mountain range, before dropping down into Silver City. I
decided to not think about this – there would still be a long way to
ride before I got there. I was still hoping that a magic bus would
appear too; I would find out more in T or&nbsp;C.</p>
<p>The sun was beating down when the guys dropped me off a little way
outside the town. I thanked them for their help and rode into town where
I ate a couple of burgers (the only food available it seemed) and tried
to find out about&nbsp;buses.</p>
<p>There is a bus, but it first goes to Deming and then there is a 10 hour
wait for the connection to Silver City. This wasn’t really going to help
me too much and so reluctantly I got back on the bike and carried on my
way&nbsp;South.</p>
<p>I rode another fifty miles or so before the heat became unbearable. I
was beginning to get dehydrated and I felt fairly wobbly on the bike. My
speed had disappeared and each push of the pedals was becoming an
effort. I stopped off in a little shop and drank a load of Gatorade and
ate ice creams and chocolate bars before getting on&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The next section was really tough and I knew that I needed to get a ride
if I was going to make it to Silver City that day. I really wanted to
finish the ride with Marco and knew that he would be trying his hardest
to get there that day; I didn’t want to miss him. I also knew that the
climbing section was approaching, and that was sure to sap all my
remaining&nbsp;strength.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much traffic on the road (I was on a smaller road now) but
every time I heard something coming behind me, I jumped off the bike and
stuck my thumb out, hoping for a lift. There were very few suitable
vehicles coming past and I began to feel sure that I wasn’t going to
make&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I was just approaching the tiny village of Hillsboro when another pickup
went past my outstretched thumb. I silently cursed them for not
stopping, climbed back on and started to pedal, only to see that they
had stopped a short way ahead of me and their reverse lights were on.
Was I rescued again?! Luckily for me, the answer was&nbsp;yes!</p>
<p>Kenny and Dominic were two cousins who had been working in Truth or
Consequences and they drove me all the way to Silver City, and kept me
entertained all the way. Nicer blokes I couldn’t have hoped to have met.
That last fifty miles or so into Silver City would have killed me, I’m
sure. The scenery was breathtaking though as we would our way up through
the deep gorge up towards the top of the mountains. Even the twisty
downhill section would have been hard work for tired legs&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The boys dropped me just outside town and I rode down the hill to try
and find the campsite. I was almost there, when I felt the all too
familiar sinking feeling; a staple had found its way into my front tyre.
I couldn’t believe it; this was New Mexico fighting back, just when I
thought that maybe the worst was&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>I found the campground, but they hadn’t seen Marco that day. I got the
tent up and showered the dust from the road out of my skin before
wandering further into town to get some food. I found an internet café
first though and so logged on to check the <span class="caps">SPOT</span> to see where Marco was.
It looked as though he was about 30 miles away and it looked like we
would be meeting up the next day – excellent&nbsp;news.</p>
<p>I ate some pasta and had a couple of beers before heading back to my
tent, knowing that there were just 123 miles between me and the border.
Surely we would be able to make that without too much trouble. After the
events of the past couple of days, I wasn’t entirely&nbsp;sure!</p>
<p><strong>July 24<br />
Day Thirty Six – Silver City to Desert – 41 miles – 2,711 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>I slept really well, but still found myself waking up at 530am, even
though the alarm wasn’t set. I phoned home to let everyone know that I
was in Silver City and would meet up with Marco later that&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>I found a great little place for breakfast and then went to check out
the bike shop; I’d got a few little problems with the bike and they
fixed them for me in no time. That done, I headed back to the internet
café and checked on Marco’s progress. He was riding well and when I saw
that he was close, I rode out to meet&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>It was great to be reunited and we caught up on the last couple of day’s
events over a big lunch. We got onto the internet in the library and
bought enough supplies to last us to the border before arranging
transport back from the border for the following afternoon. It was hard
to imagine that in less than 24 hours this would all be&nbsp;over….</p>
<p>We set out from Silver City in the heat of the day along the highway. We
had some long, steep hills to get over and I was feeling very tired
indeed, despite having not ridden that morning. After 18 miles we turned
off the highway and onto our last section of gravel road. Actually, this
was a sand road and it was supposed to be steadily downhill. I think
that I’d started to relax or something, because I couldn’t ride very
quickly that afternoon. My legs felt very heavy and even the smallest of
hills had me struggling. Once again though, the scenery was spectacular
– we were surrounded by huge amounts of nothing, just amazing&nbsp;desert.</p>
<p>We rode over our penultimate Continental Divide crossing as the sun was
going down. It was a perfect evening for riding; I just wished that I
was feeling a little bit stronger. We pulled to a halt by the side of
the trail and set up our camp in the last moments of light of the day. I
was hot and had my shirt off, trying to cool down a little bit as we
tucked in to pasta and tomato sauce in the middle of nowhere. We could
see the glow of lights from one of the larger towns miles and miles
away, but apart from that, there was no other sign of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>That night we slept under the stars, without bothering with tents and
the night sky was fantastic, full of stars, reminding me of my night
under the stars in New Zealand – there was no chance of a frosty
sleeping bag this time&nbsp;though!</p>
<p><strong>July 25<br />
Day Thirty Seven – Desert to Antelope Wells – 83 miles – 2,794 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>And then, all of a sudden, it was the final day and there were just over
80 miles to go to the border. But still I wouldn’t let myself think that
it was going to be easy. The punctures of the days before were still
fresh in my mind and I knew that we needed to ride pretty quickly to be
in time for our shuttle to pick us up at the border. The heat was going
to be a factor&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>We were up and packed before it was light, and we hit the trail just as
the sun was rising. It was a truly magical way to start the final day of
the ride. After about ten miles, we crossed over the railroad tracks and
arrived at Separ. I decided to stop at the local store and get some
drinks. Marco was worried about his front tyre as it was full of thorns
and he wanted to just get to the border as soon as he could. The lady in
the store had obviously seen it all before and told me that it was easy
from here on in. She also sold me some “5 Hour Energy” drink, saying
that it was just what I needed. It certainly didn’t do me any harm and I
felt great as I set out alongside the highway to the start of the long
paved section, marking 65 miles to the&nbsp;border.</p>
<p>This was it. Five weeks of riding had come down to just this. I filmed a
little video of myself at the start of the so-called Lonely Highway. I
wasn’t worried about the distance; 65 miles on the road should be fairly
easy. No, this was more of a mental&nbsp;challenge.</p>
<p>I crossed over the Continental Divide for the final time, but it was a
little bit disappointing being little more than a bump in the road. I
rode quickly to the small town of Hachita where I stopped for a little
break with a couple of locals, who were sat inside a small shop, selling
used bits and pieces of junk and giving away free coffee (for a small
donation of&nbsp;course!)</p>
<p>Refreshed, I turned past the little church and began the last 45 miles.
If I had been feeling tired, this road would have been a killer. All the
way, mile markers were counting down to the border and so I always knew
how far I had left to go. I stopped a few times to drink more Gatorade
and water but apart from that it was all about just getting to the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p>I remember stopping at mile marker 4 and having a little tear in my eye.
I knew now that I was going to make it, but part of me wanted it to
carry on. The last mile was a real blast. I decided to ride it as
quickly as I could, amusing to try and sprint after the best part of
three thousand miles, but I had to give it a&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Marco was there waiting as I rode into the border area, punching the air
in delight. I’d been thinking about this moment for the best part of a
year but once I was there, I couldn’t quite believe&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The border guards were awesome and they gave us free drinks from the
vending machine and came outside to take our picture at the border. A
wonderful way to end the&nbsp;trip.</p>
