                <p><strong>June 26<br />
Day Eight - Seeley Lake to Lincoln - 53 miles - 522 miles total<span
style="font-weight: normal;"></span></strong></p>
<p>After a disturbingly short sleep, the alarm sounded and was promptly
silenced. I was exhausted and felt like I&#8217;d only just crawled into my
sleeping bag. Fortunately, Ollie and Marco both seemed to be a bit on
the slow side this morning, but wandered into town to get some
breakfast, leaving me in the tent to get myself&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>I managed to drag myself up and out and walked into Seeley Lake to try
and join the others for some breakfast. The place we&#8217;d agreed to meet
only served coffee, but the lady there was very friendly and told me
that she&#8217;d given Ollie and Marco a lift (a lift!!!) up the road to
somewhere serving a good breakfast. With her good turn for the day
already done, I received no offer of a ride and so had to slowly make my
way up the road to the diner.<br />
<!--more--><br />
As if things weren&#8217;t bad enough, I arrived to discover that Michael
Jackson had died. I look forward to telling the tale of remembering
where I was when I learned of his death&#8230;..or maybe&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Anyway, a good breakfast cheered us all up a bit and we got the tents
packed away and set off on the way to&nbsp;Lincoln</p>
<p>I was feeling very tired and soon dropped back behind the others, but
decided to try to keep on going, but at the same time wondering how I
was going to cope with the rest of the ride. Here I was, just one week
in and feeling like&nbsp;death</p>
<p>Thanks to our very late start that morning, the sun was already beating
down, and I was really feeling the heat and I was doing possibly the
worst thing I could do - watching the computer on my handlebars as it
slowly crept&nbsp;along</p>
<p>After 26 miles, we arrived in the town of Ovando where we were treated
to the best sandwiches on the whole route. If ever you find yourself
near Ovando, then you simply must stop at The Stray Bullet and sample
one (or two) of their fantastic&nbsp;sarnies.</p>
<p>Refreshed, I took quite a difficult decision. I would skip the rest of
the trail to Lincoln and take the road instead. This would give me an
easier afternoon, meaning that I would arrive a little earlier and be
able to get a bit more sleep. It was a tough decision as I wanted to
complete the whole route, but I also knew that the ride up Huckleberry
Pass would most likely exhaust me, and I would be slowing the others
down&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>After a brief moment where Ollie was considering both taking the road
and going on further than Lincoln, I set off down the road and Ollie and
Marco headed out on the trail, agreeing to meet up at the campground in
Lincoln later that&nbsp;afternoon.</p>
<p>My ride along the road was unsurprisingly dull and had a few big long
hills to get up and down along the way. I stopped a couple of times to
get out of the sun for a while, and to make sure I was completely
hydrated (I think this had added to my problems the day&nbsp;before).</p>
<p>I arrived in Lincoln in the middle of the afternoon, got the tent
pitched and took a great shower before falling asleep for an hour or so.
I had just woken up when Marco and Ollie arrived with tales of a quite
easy climb and great views that I had missed. Still, I was happy that
I&#8217;d managed to get an extra bit of sleeping&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>That evening, we got our laundry done, did some grocery shopping, ate
pizza and drank beer. I was even starting to look forward to getting
back on the road in the&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p><strong>June 27<br />
Day Nine - Lincoln to Helena - 65 miles - 587 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Today was going to be a tough day and so we were up pretty early and
after a large breakfast we were on the road. Although our destination
Helena was at a lower altitude than Lincoln, today was going to be an
uphill day, with three Continental Divide crossings and a profile that
looked pretty challenging to say the&nbsp;least.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the first climb of the day, I remember looking down and
thinking &#8220;I don&#8217;t recognise my own legs&#8221;. Quite an odd thought to have,
but it did make me feel a bit better about feeling tired the previous
couple of days - my body was changing shape, I was obviously working&nbsp;hard.</p>
<p>We stopped for an early first lunch at the bottom of the second climb
and got the tents dried out in the sun, before setting off again. Marco
went on ahead and we agreed to meet him over the top at Dog&nbsp;Creek.</p>
<p>The last part of the climb was very steep and had both Ollie and I
pushing and wondering when it was going to end - &#8220;it must be just around
this&nbsp;bend&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>A bumpy downhill took us down to Dog Creek and we met back up with Marco
for a second lunch, before we set off again, heading towards the third
Continental Divide crossing of the day, Priest Pass. On the map, the
climb looked pretty steep, but in reality it was pretty easy. Two miles,
along a really good gravel road in some wonderful surroundings - perfect
for the third and final big climb of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>A steep downhill followed and then about ten miles along the highway
took us into the town of Helena where we hoped to find a bike shop to
get some supplies. The first shop we tried was closed and so we rode
across town to another shop which was also closed. The owner was still
inside however and saw us arrive and so came to help us&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Ollie bought some new bike shoes as his had fallen apart and we picked
up a few other bits and pieces before heading along to a hotel just down
the road. A good cheap room, a good feed and a couple of beers rounded
off the day very nicely indeed. Things were looking&nbsp;up.</p>
<p><strong>June 28<br />
Day Ten - Helena to Butte - 72 miles - 659 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Breakfast in the hotel was followed by a long steady climb out of town
before we stopped for photos next to the only Great Divide Mountain Bike
Route signs on the whole&nbsp;trip.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the morning riding uphill and then ate first lunch
before starting on the roughest toughest section we&#8217;d faced so far -
Lava Mountain. The guide book promised two miles of tough singletrack
riding and that was an&nbsp;understatement.</p>
<p>The first section was basically a vertical wall which then became a
rocky slope. Ollie and I pushed for what seemed like hours, but Marco
was having a great time and managed to ride the whole thing, although he
looked a bit tired when we eventually rejoined him at the top. I really
didn&#8217;t enjoy that section at all, even the downhill sections were too
steep for me to ride - I did try a couple of times, but without making
any real&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>Over the top, we began the descent to the settlement of Basin - not so
much a town as a collection of houses. They did have a pub and cafe
though, so we stopped for a drink and a bite to eat - much needed after
the miles of&nbsp;pushing.</p>
<p>Out of Basin, we took a &#8220;Non-maintained Cattle Trail&#8221;, which was nowhere
near as bad as it sounds and we followed this track alongside the
highway before joining the highway for the final few very fast very
downhill miles into&nbsp;Butte.</p>
<p>We got a room in the first motel we found, and after a shower headed out
for some food, which disappointingly turned out to be burgers&nbsp;again&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>June 29<br />
Day Eleven - Butte to Elkhorn Hot Springs - 86 miles - 745 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Ollie and I left Marco in bed and headed down for some breakfast before
hitting the road out of Butte. Today was going to be our &#8220;Top Gear&#8221;
style challenge&nbsp;day&#8230;.</p>
<p>The challenge? Could Marco (aka Jeremy Clarkson) beat Ollie and I (James
May and Richard Hammond), riding on his Ferrari-like carbon bike over
the longer and harder section of the course, whilst we took our Volvos
on the easier section. To even things up a little bit, Marco would have
to wait until 10am when the Butte bike shop opened, whilst Ollie and I
hit the road nice and&nbsp;early.</p>
<p>The road from Butte was not too bad, although it was paved for quite a
while. When the climbing started, it was fairly gentle and the trail was
in good condition. It was however, quite a long steady climb, but the
view from the top was well worth the effort expended to get there -
simply spectacular views over to the Pioneer mountain range in the
distance - we would be heading towards them all&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We stayed up quite high for a while before a steep descent took us down
to the main highway. The road was in the middle of being repaired and
large amounts of sand covered the road. About a third of the way down,
my front wheel got stuck in some deep sand and got stuck. The rest of
the bike and the trailer wanted to carry on though, resulting in me
being catapulted off the bike. Fortunately, the landing was relatively
soft and I wasn&#8217;t travelling too quickly, so I just picked up some
scratches, bumps and bruises. I also managed to hurt my ribs again, but
nowhere near as badly as I did in&nbsp;Calgary.</p>
<p>We ate lunch at the bottom and discussed which route to take. After the
long section of pushing yesterday, neither of us was keen to have to do
the same again, and so we opted to take the paved alternative route to
Wise&nbsp;River.</p>
<p>After a drinks stop in Divide we rode along the road and into Wise River
for a bite to eat and to await Marco&#8217;s arrival. Ollie managed to get
wifi access on his phone and we had a quick check of the live tracking
page on bikingthegreatdivide.com, to see where Marco was. He seemed to
be making good progress but Ollie was keen to keep going so we waited
until we could see he was out of the tough section, then left a note at
the cafe and set off&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The first section of the road was fairly dull, but soon became really
special. We followed the path of the Wise River through some spectacular
scenery. It would have been perfect if it hadn&#8217;t been for the mosquitoes
that were everywhere. As soon as we stopped to take a photo or to check
the map, we would be surrounded by a swarm of biting mosquitoes (I&#8217;m
itching now, just thinking about&nbsp;it!).</p>
<p>When we started to climb, things just got worse; at speed, the mossies
couldn&#8217;t really keep up, but going slowly, they had an absolute feast on
us. At one point I just gave up, stopped and ripped open my <span class="caps">BOB</span> bag to
get my <span class="caps">DEET</span> spray out. Although I got bitten quite badly whilst I was
stopped, the bug spray seemed to do the trick and the mossies were a
little less&nbsp;aggressive.</p>
<p>Of course, all the time this was going on, we were looking over our
shoulders, expecting to hear the roar of the Ferrari engine coming after
us. The longer we went without hearing or seeing Marco, the more
confident we were that we could beat&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Finally, Ollie and I arrived at the top of the hill and began a fast,
steep descent to Elkhorn Hot Springs. We had originally planned to go on
a bit further, but were just discussing how to let Marco know where we
were when he came speeding round the corner. The <span class="caps">BBC</span> couldn&#8217;t have
scripted it any better! The only bad news is that the bike shop had
almost none of the stuff we needed, as it had been cleared out by the
racers who had passed through a week or two&nbsp;earlier.</p>
<p>We had an excellent meal in the pub and then pitched our tents in the
local campsite before setting our alarms for early the next morning -
tomorrow was going to be a long hard&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>June 30<br />
Day Twelve - Elkhorn Hot Springs to Lima - 107 miles - 852 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We got up in the dark and set off as it was getting light. It was still
pretty cold and we wore all the clothes we could for the downhill
section. We hadn&#8217;t gone very far before we were stopped by a huge number
of cows coming up the road towards us, herded along by cowboys and
cowgirls. We stopped, hoping that the cows would just pass us by, but
this seemed to be the wrong thing to do, so after a while we just
saddled up and rode through&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>It was just as well we did, as there were thousands of cows and it was a
good few miles before we got to the back of the pack, and more cowboys
bringing up the&nbsp;rear.</p>
<p>We passed through the settlement of Polaris, notable only because it
marked the end of our second map. The road continued slowly downhill,
but the scenery had really changed from the previous few days of riding.
We were out of the forests and into the wide plains of&nbsp;Montana.</p>
<p>We turned onto a gravel road and into Bannack State Park where we got a
first taste of what the &#8216;flat&#8217; sections on the map were going to be
like. Lots of small roller-coaster-type ups and downs, without a hint of
a flat&nbsp;section.</p>
<p>We had a good long downhill and took a small diversion off the road to
the town of Grant, where we were looking for a big breakfast.
Unfortunately, the hotel / restaurant there looks like it has been
closed for a good long while and so we were out of luck. With 40 miles
to the next town, there was no hope of a good cooked breakfast, so we
had to make do with oatmeal cooked up on Marco&#8217;s stove. We were all so
dejected, especially after riding over 30 miles that morning with the
expectation of a good feed&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Still feeling hungry, we set off again and it was back to the uphill for
us. Just a steady climb, but one that lasted for over thirty miles. At
the bottom of the steepest part, I was really struggling and we all
stopped for a rest. Worryingly, a storm was passing very close to us and
the sky was soon pretty black. We learned later on that had we been on
top of the climb, we would have been in big big trouble as huge hail
stones were raining down up there - the ranger said he was worried about
his pickup being dented, they were so&nbsp;large.</p>
<p>Not wanting to get caught in the bad weather, we pushed on, stopping
only long enough for me to eat a huge amount of trail mix. This wasn&#8217;t
such a good idea as I threw up part the way up the steep section - not a
good way to go. At the top, we got caught in another, thankfully less
violent, storm before starting a long downhill ride to our planned
destination for the night, Lima, still some 35 miles&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>We met a couple of motorcyclists who were following the route, weighed
down with their heavy bikes and kit. We would meet many more bikers over
the coming weeks, but few so friendly as these&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>The downhill section was great and took us through some amazing canyons,
before the road turned a little bit sandy and sticky towards the end. We
hit the highway and we all knew that it was just seven miles to Lima. We
all thought it would be downhill, but the road was slightly uphill and
into the wind - not what we&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>I was exhausted and even the sight of Lima in the distance didn&#8217;t help -
it just didn&#8217;t seem to be getting any closer, no matter how hard I tried
to pedal. Finally, we turned under the interstate highway and into&nbsp;Lima.</p>
<p>We must have looked awful as we arrived into the restaurant. I was so
tired that I couldn&#8217;t even get my gloves off and couldn&#8217;t be bothered to
look at the menu - I just ordered the same as&nbsp;Marco!</p>
<p>After a bite to eat and drink though, our achievement began to sink in.
We had covered 107 miles that day - our first century of the trip. We
got the tents up and then went back to eat more food before crawling
into our sleeping bags looking forward to a good&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p><strong>August 1<br />
Day Thirteen - Lima, Montana to Sawtelle Resort, Idaho - 88 miles - 940
miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>The infamous Day 13 had arrived. Little did we know how much this day
would affect the whole trip. I don&#8217;t know why or how I realised that it
was day 13 at the time, but sitting down for breakfast, it seemed
somehow significant that both Ollie and I chose breakfast number 13 from
the menu - maybe I knew something was going to&nbsp;happen&#8230;..</p>
<p>We set off and immediately I was feeling pretty strong on the undulating
road. On the map, today was going to be a fairly flat day, with just one
small steep climb, but with some longer sections of gradual incline, and
that&#8217;s how it started&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>I think we were all feeling tired but encouraged by the fact that we&#8217;d
completed our first 100 mile day the day before. Ollie stopped for a
call of nature and then just didn&#8217;t catch us up. I stopped to wait and
got news from a passing farmer that he had stopped to fix a flat tyre
and would soon be on his way. I waited and waited and waited and finally
decided that I should ride back and check all was <span class="caps">OK</span>.</p>
<p>I unhitched the trailer (can&#8217;t do that with panniers) and rode back,
eventually finding that he was riding back to join us. The tyre was
badly damaged and the makeshift solution of a strip of gaffa tape wasn&#8217;t
going to last too&nbsp;long.</p>
<p>We stopped again and swapped the damaged tyre to the front wheel, where
it would carry less weight, hopefully making it last longer. By the time
we&#8217;d started again, we&#8217;d lost about an hour - our good start had been
wiped&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>From then on, we stopped every half an hour or so to get Ollie&#8217;s tyre
pumped up again as it was leaking air slowly. After lunch we stopped a
passing pickup truck and got Ollie in the back with the plan that he
would get to a bike shop to get his bike fixed and pick up spare parts
for Marco and I. We would then meet up as soon as possible and carry on
to&nbsp;Mexico.</p>
<p>Passing through the settlement of Lakeview - a wonderful setting, with
the continental divide behind and views over the Red Rock Lakes - I
began to feel unwell and the surface deteriorated into a sandy rocky
mess of a road. Before too long, I had to stop at the side of the road
and was violently ill, but worse than I had been the day&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>I got back on and made my way slowly along the track to join up with
Marco, who was fighting with the mosquitoes as he waited for me. We
could see the clouds coming in and we still had one pass to get over. We
rode the bottom section together - I just wanted to get the day over and
done with. Marco went ahead up the climb, but it was shorter than we
both thought it would be, and before too long I passed over the top and
into the state of&nbsp;Idaho.</p>
<p>I was ill again going down from the pass and by the time we got to
Henrys Lake, I was exhausted. Luckily, we passed a farm where there
seemed to be a barbecue going on. We cheekily went and asked if we could
have a drink and we were told to take as much (water) as we&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>It turned out that we had come across the local night out - a big
barbecue attracting up to 150 locals each week. We chatted to a couple
of the early arrivals before getting back on our&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>A few more miles took us to our spot for the night; the Sawtelle Resort.
We went to the pub and ordered food, but I couldn&#8217;t eat any of mine, so
Marco got a second helping before we checked in to a nearby motel and
crashed for the&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>Day 13 had turned out to be an unlucky day for us&nbsp;all.</p>
<p><strong>August 2<br />
Day Fourteen - Sawtelle Resort to Squirrel Creek - 67 miles - 1,007
miles total<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></strong></p>
<p>I woke up late and felt immediately hungry, which I took to be a good
sign. I felt like I could do with a rest day, but wanted to keep the
team together and catch up with Ollie, who we learned was heading
towards Jackson. Marco and I put a plan together and then got ready and
headed out for some&nbsp;breakfast.</p>
<p>Mine wasn&#8217;t a complete success as I didn&#8217;t manage to eat too much. Once
again, Marco got a second&nbsp;helping!</p>
<p>We got back onto the trail and almost immediately I fell off. The trail
was on an old railway line and was very bumpy (where the sleepers had
been) and covered in a deep, soft sand which seemed to grab hold of my
front tyre repeatedly. I picked myself up time and time again, but after
about an hour and a half I realised that I was never going to make it
for another 20 miles of this surface. I lost count of how many times I
fell off - it was around 8 times&nbsp;though&#8230;</p>
<p>Marco was going pretty well on the surface, although even he admitted it
was pretty hard going. I decided to take the road and meet up with Marco
in Ashton, about 30 miles&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>The road was pretty dull and I had a huge long climb to get up, but was
rewarded at the top by seeing the sign that told me that the next five
miles would be steep&nbsp;downhill!</p>
<p>I met up with Marco in Ashton and we had a bite to eat, which
fortunately I managed to keep down this time and then we set off again,
ending our day at the Squirrel Creek campground. What a perfect place
this&nbsp;was.</p>
<p>We were given a warm welcome by the owners and after we got changed and
put the tent up, we were treated to a wonderful chicken dinner. I was
very glad I had my appetite back, I would have hated to miss out on such
a home-made treat. We chatted away to the owners whilst stuffing our
faces with rhubarb crumble and custard - what a delicious treat! After
an exhausting day, it was a perfect way to crash and relax. I was so
tired that I didn&#8217;t even notice that we passed the 1,000 mile&nbsp;mark&#8230;..</p>
