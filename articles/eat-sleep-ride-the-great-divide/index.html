                </div>
                <p>I was riding along yesterday, with my head down in to the wind,
pedalling hard (even on the downhills) just to keep some momentum, the
thought occurred to me that I&#8217;d much rather be at home watching the&nbsp;cricket!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a tough few days for me. After the highlight of completing our
first 100 mile day on the way to Lima, came the disastrous Day 13. We
should have known it was going to be a bad day, but still Ollie and I
both ordered Breakfast Number 13 from the menu at the local&nbsp;cafe.</p>
<p>The day started out well and we were making good progress until Ollie
stopped for a call of nature by the trailside and then never caught us
up. He had a massive puncture caused by a tear to the rim of his rear&nbsp;tyre.</p>
<p>I unhooked the trailer and headed back to find him and then we all
helped to change the patched tyre onto the front wheel, where it would
bear less&nbsp;weight.</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t improve much after that. We were getting slower and slower
and eventually we loaded Ollie into the back of a pickup truck to get to
the nearest bike shop (wherever that may be), to get his bike fixed and
also to pick up some supplies for Marco and&nbsp;I.</p>
<p>That was the last we saw of him. He got a ride part of the way and then
rode on some more, eventually arriving at the end of the next day in
Jackson. From there he chose to cut a corner and rode along the road to
Pinedale where he picked up the trail once&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marco and I hit some horrible sandy roads and I was getting
slower and slower. I also began to feel quite sick and before long, I
was throwing up at the roadside. Still, we carried on, up over a pass
and into Idaho - maybe our luck would change with a new&nbsp;state?</p>
<p>On the other side of the pass, I wasn&#8217;t feeling much better and we
stopped off at a local barbeque, where all the folk from the surrounding
area were starting to gather for a big party. They gave us some water
and I started to feel a bit better. It would have been an interesting
place to spend a few hours I&#8217;m sure, but we still had ten miles to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>That evening, I tried to eat some dinner, but couldn&#8217;t and so retired to
bed in a local motel feeling terrible and not knowing whether I would be
able to carry&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Next day, I felt a little better, but still couldn&#8217;t manage much
breakfast. The trail that day was horrible - an old railway line, with
all the sleeper bumps in it and a sandy surface that sucked at the
tyres. I lost count of the number of times I fell off and so decided to
cut my losses and hit the&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>I met back up with Marco in the town of Ashton, where I heard all about
the great views I&#8217;d missed, but also about the state of the&nbsp;trail.</p>
<p>After a late lunch / early dinner we rode the fifteen or so miles to
Squirrel Creek where we were given a wonderful welcome from our hosts.
They prepared an amazing dinner for us - breaded chicken with salad and
potatoes and pasta salad, with rhubarb crumble and custard for desert.
Thank goodness I was feeling better - I would have hated to miss out on
that&nbsp;feast!</p>
<p>Next morning, we hit the trail early after a great breakfast and made
good progress, although the dreaded mosquitoes were never far away. We
heard news from Ollie, that he was not going to meet up with us again,
and so we decided to take a detour off the route to&nbsp;Jackson.\  </p>
<p>The road there was amazing - with awesome views of the Teton mountains
and the view from Jenny Lake was worth the ride&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p>We stopped off in the settlement of Moose for a cold drink (and we even
saw a Moose from the side of the road!), and then pedalled our hardest
to try to avoid the storm that was headed our way. We got into Jackson
and found a motel to stay in before Marco crashed out. He was getting
the same sickness that I had had a couple of days&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>We spent the next day (4th July) in Jackson and managed to avoid the
grand parade, spending our time in the bike and camping shops, stocking
up on&nbsp;supplies.</p>
<p>Back on the bikes, we had a long ride and rode through some amazing
surroundings before having a barbeque dinner (with live music) and then
riding through the sunset and riding / pushing up a big hill to camp
just before Union&nbsp;Pass.</p>
<p>Marco was troubled in the night by some inquisitive cows who got a bit
too close for comfort to his tent, but otherwise we had a good night&#8217;s
sleep. I ahd even managed to put mine up correctly in the dark. I was
glad that I had practised in the motel room in&nbsp;Jackson!!</p>
<p>Next morning we rode up over Union Pass and made it to the only cafe on
the route that day, just before a huge storm came over. The local
cowboys&#8217; horses and our bikes were parked outside and got a huge
soaking, but we were safe inside with our cheeseburgers and&nbsp;lemonade.</p>
<p>The weather cleared up and we rode into Pinedale, where we had a huge
stroke of luck. On the lookout for some pasta, we were directed to the
local micro-brewery where we found no pasta, but couchsurfing host, Amy.
We had requested a place to stay when we were in Banff, but because of
the limited internet access we&#8217;ve had along the way we hadn&#8217;t seen that
she&#8217;d accepted our&nbsp;request.</p>
<p>After finding some pasta in the local pizza place, we rode in the dark
to Boulder where we had a great night&#8217;s sleep on the&nbsp;couch.</p>
