                <p><strong>July 10<br />
Day Twenty Two – Slater to Steamboat – 63 miles – 1,644 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We were up and about before sunrise and although it was pretty chilly,
it looked as though it was going to be a good day. We heated oatmeal and
drank tea before setting off towards the town of Steamboat. I had been
very disappointed about not making it as far as we&#8217;d hoped the day
before, but set off determined to ride better today; knowing that we
were only going to ride about 60 miles certainly helped. I hoped it
would feel like a rest day, which sounds a bit crazy, now I think about&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>The trail was a good one again and we were making pretty good time even
though it was uphill for most of the morning. Marco went on ahead and I
continued the climb on my own. The last mile and a half was very rocky
indeed and I had to push most of&nbsp;it.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>A steep and rocky downhill followed and I started to think
about whether I would be able to finish the route. Marco was clearly
much faster and more proficient than I was and I was pretty sure that I
would be riding the rest of the route on my own. It wasn&#8217;t really fair
to expect him to keep waiting for me all the time. I didn&#8217;t want to quit
now, but I also didn&#8217;t really fancy riding the rest of the way on my&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>I was slightly miserable buy the time I pulled up outside the general
store at Clark, where I met back up with Marco. We sat and chatted about
the morning&#8217;s route as I munched my way through a delicious freshly made
sandwich and made arrangements to meet up further down the road in&nbsp;Steamboat.</p>
<p>The road section into Steamboat passed very quickly indeed and as soon
as I got into town, I made my way to the bike shop to get some urgent
repairs on the bike. Whilst the bike was being fixed, I headed to the
library and used the internet for the first time in a while and caught
up on some of the news from home, even managing an online chat with Dad,
who had been avidly following our progress thanks to the <span class="caps">SPOT</span> device and
Google&nbsp;Earth.</p>
<p>I met back up with Marco at the bike shop and we also met up with Steve
Williams, who has cycled just about everywhere in the world. He was very
interested in our trip and sounded as though he had a thousand stories
and tips to share with us. Have a look at his <a href="http://www.stevendwilliams.com/">website</a> to see where
he has been – truly&nbsp;amazing.</p>
<p>In the evening we sat outside and had a beer and some lovely pasta (just
what we needed), before riding out to the campground, just out of town.
The campground was completely packed and at first it looked as though
the owners were going to turn us away. Thankfully, they found a spot for
us and we fought the mosquitoes off as we got the tents put&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>I spent a while adding some padding tape to my handlebars. I&#8217;d bought
the tape way back in Jackson, but hadn&#8217;t made the time to get it onto
the bars before then. My hands were in a pretty bad state from all the
vibrations, every little bit of extra padding was going to be hugely&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p><strong>July 11<br />
Day Twenty Three – Steamboat to Kremmling – 80 miles – 1,724 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We rode into town for an early breakfast, then bought supplies from the
supermarket before a quick visit to the local outdoor store. We had
discussed Marco going on ahead on his own and needed to make sure that
we both had the correct equipment if he did&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>The trail headed out of Steamboat alongside the river before it started
to climb up towards Lynx Pass, some thirty miles or so ahead. At
Stagecoach Reservoir, we joined up with the Elk Run Trail, a singletrack
path following the water&#8217;s edge for a short while, before getting back
onto the gravel roads for more&nbsp;climbing.</p>
<p>I met back up with Marco for some lunch in the shade of a tree and we
made arrangements to meet up in Kremmling that evening. He set off again
as I finished up my lunch and so I was surprised to catch him up after a
few minutes of riding. He was chatting to a couple of motorcyclists who
were riding the trail from South to North. They were full of
superlatives about parts of the route, but also warned us about New
Mexico, where they had had a bit of a tough&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>I crossed over Lynx Pass and began a good descent as the weather started
to deteriorate. The next obstacle was a deep creek that had to be
crossed. A couple of holidaying families were having a picnic on the
banks and I chatted with them for a few minutes before pushing the bike
and trailer through the shin-deep&nbsp;water.</p>
<p>I then started out on one of my least favourite sections of the whole
ride. The track conditions deteriorated and I began to really slow down
thanks to a few miles of steep climbs and descents. I had been making
pretty good progress up until then, but this section seemed to take me
forever. To make matters worse, our old friends the mosquitoes were out
in force too, making it almost impossible to stop and&nbsp;rest.</p>
<p>I finally made it to the high point and had a stunning view over the
valley below. I could also see the &#8216;town&#8217; of Radium down there- my next
port of call. The downhill was very steep indeed and the drop in
altitude was remarkable. The temperature changed dramatically for one
thing, and the vegetation at the bottom bore no resemblance to that at
the top – it was quite&nbsp;incredible.</p>
<p>As I crossed the river and began to climb out of Radium, the weather
started to take a turn for the worse and I did consider turning around
and putting my tent up, but decided to push on and try to make it to&nbsp;Kremmling.</p>
<p>Part way up the first part of the steep section, I got a Tour de France
style push from a fella who had obviously been watching the <span class="caps">TV</span> coverage
of the race. He ran along shouting “Allez, Allez!” as he ran alongside
me. It made me smile, but didn&#8217;t help me up the hill too&nbsp;much!</p>
<p>The climb just seemed to drag on and on but then suddenly I was at the
top and screaming downhill on the other side It was a good job that I
was riding into the wind, as I managed to get up to about 42 miles an
hour, without even&nbsp;trying.</p>
<p>Sadly, the downhill was very short lived and I was climbing up towards
Inspiration Point, from where I was able to get a superb view over the
valley below. A freight train was on its way from Radium through the
valley and that added to the&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>I stopped to wolf down a few snacks that kept me going over the top of
the hill and then it was downhill all the way into Kremmling. I had made
it – the last 20 miles from Radium had been tough, but I had proved to
myself that I could make it to the border on my own if I needed&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>I bought some drinks from a gas station and rode back through town,
trying to locate the library, where I was supposed to catch up with
Marco. I couldn&#8217;t find it, so headed to the campground thinking that he
may just have gone straight there. I didn&#8217;t find him there though and
with no mobile reception, decided to get myself sorted before searching
further for&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>I got the tent up and had a wonderful shower and sort of cleaned some of
my riding clothes – they would soon be dry given the strength of the
wind. Once I was cleaned and organised, I rode back in to town to try
and find Marco and to get some&nbsp;food.</p>
<p>On my second sweep through the main street, I found him in one of the
pubs and joined him for yet another burger and a (well-deserved) cold&nbsp;beer.</p>
<p><strong>July 12<br />
Day Twenty Four – Kremmling to Silverthorne – 56 miles – 1,780 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>I slept very well and woke feeling very positive, looking forward to
another shorter day. The positivity soon disappeared though as I noticed
that my back tyre was flat – I must have picked up a puncture riding
back from dinner the evening&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>It took us a while to get it fixed and so the cafe was already pretty
busy by the time we arrived for breakfast. After ordering, I dashed
across the road to phone home and wish Mum a happy&nbsp;birthday.</p>
<p>Full of pancakes and cinnamon rolls, we set off towards Silverthorne.
After a couple of miles, Marco decided that he wanted to have a fast day
and so we decided to split up again, agreeing to meet at a lunch spot
around 30 miles into the route, at the bottom of the main climb of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>The ride was all uphill, but I was making good progress on the excellent
surface and it wasn&#8217;t too long before I met back up with Marco at the
side of the road for&nbsp;lunch.</p>
<p>Refreshed after lunch, Marco set off up towards the final steep section
of the climb up to Ute Pass. As I reached the last few miles, I was
slightly surprised to see Marco coming back the other way. Had we gone
the wrong way? Was the road closed? The answer was much simpler; Marco
wanted a race up to the top. I&#8217;m afraid I wasn&#8217;t much competition for
him although I kept him within my sight for a bit longer than I usually
would have&nbsp;done!</p>
<p>At the top of the climb, we were met with Jim, who was out for a ride on
his road bike, whilst on vacation in the area. We chatted and rode
together as the paved road started to take us downhill. He was (like
pretty much everyone else we met along the way) fascinated by our
adventure and even more amazed at the speed that we were able to go at
down the hill. The weight of the trailer gives us an extra boost,
compensating for the extra drag of the fatter tyres. Jim and Marco got
into their aerodynamic &#8216;tuck&#8217; positions and raced down the hill. I took
advantage of the downhill and sat up and relaxed. The racers got up to
about 47mph, I only managed about 42 – still pretty quick&nbsp;though!!</p>
<p>I have to say that little section of maybe three or four miles was one
of my favourite parts of the route. Not just because it was downhill and
fast, but because we got some amazing mountain views on the way down
too. If we were to ride have been riding from South to North though,
this would have probably been one of the hardest&nbsp;climbs!</p>
<p>After chatting away with Jim at the bottom of the hill, we then just had
to deal with the thirteen miles of gradual uphill along the busy highway
into Silverthorne. Once in Silverthorne, we stopped at the supermarket
and filled up on energy drink, milk and&nbsp;chocolate.</p>
<p>That night, we were lucky enough to be staying with Heike, thanks to
couchsurfing once again. In her back yard, we hung out the tents to dry,
got the sleeping bags well aired and did some work on the bikes - giving
them a general tune up and changing the&nbsp;chains.</p>
<p>That evening, we headed out of town to a local micro brewery for a
couple of beers and a big plate of pasta as the sun went down. An
excellent end to a great&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>July 13<br />
Day Twenty Five – Silverthorne to Hartsel – 73 miles – 1,853 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Heike cooked us a yummy breakfast and once we&#8217;d packed our stuff we were
back on the road again. We had a few problems finding the correct trail
out of town and then we had to get up a steep, but thankfully short
climb up to the Dillon Reservoir. There we joined a cycle path that was
very well used indeed. I was amazed to see so many people out riding,
and all of them waved or said hello as we went&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>We followed the edge of the reservoir to the small town of Frisco where
we found the bike shop and a lovely bakery for a cinnamon roll. Back on
the bike path, we made our way up towards Breckenridge. It was along
this path that I discovered that I wasn&#8217;t actually that slow, as I
passed many a cyclist on the way, and none of them was towing a&nbsp;trailer!</p>
<p>In Breckenridge, we got some supplies from the supermarket and then
visited the local library to get some internet access. While we were in
there, the weather turned; the skies turned very grey and the rain began
pouring down – not great news for us, although a couple of locals told
me that it wouldn&#8217;t last. I hoped they were&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>We ate some lunch and then decided to head out into the rain. We hadn&#8217;t
made it very far before Marco had a problem with his chain. We tried to
get it fixed in the supermarket car park, but had no joy, so Marco took
it into one of the bike shops in town to get it fixed. I carried on
ahead, and got a head start on Boreas&nbsp;Pass.</p>
<p>On the map this looked like a horrible climb, being about 10 miles long
and climbing about 2,000 feet in altitude. In reality it was a great
climb. The track was in great condition and gave wonderful views back
down the valley. The weather got better as I climbed up and by the time
I got near the top it was pretty warm. I started to have a few problems
with my breathing at this point and so eased back a bit. I looked back
to see if I could spot Marco racing up behind me, but couldn&#8217;t see him
and so really took it&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p>I could see the sign marking the top of the climb when I heard him
racing past me, breathing hard. I couldn&#8217;t believe it! I had been beaten
to the top once again, even with a big head&nbsp;start!</p>
<p>We stopped for a breather at the top, which was harder than you might
think; we were at 11,482 feet (3,500 metres) and the oxygen was
noticeably less than down at the bottom. I was as high as Namche Bazaar
in Nepal, the first stop on the Everest&nbsp;Trek.</p>
<p>Going down the other side was awesome; a steady fast gravel road took us
toward the small village of Como. As we approached, the heavens opened
and the headwind started to get stronger. I rode straight through the
place and had to turn back around to find the local restaurant where
Marco was&nbsp;waiting.</p>
<p>The front door was pretty stiff and so I pushed hard and ended up
basically falling into the place. And what a place it was. I was in
heaven when they told me that one of the owners was an Englishman and
that they served <span class="caps">PG</span> Tips tea – I ordered a pot straight&nbsp;away!</p>
<p>After a lovely bowl of soup, I munched my way through a great sandwich
and then had desert as well. I was pretty keen to stay there (they had
rooms too) but I knew we should probably get moving&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Luckily, the rain had stopped by the time we left. The wind however, was
stronger than ever, and of course we had to ride into it. I had real
trouble even pushing the pedals round as my belly was so full! <span class="caps">II</span> found
that I had to sit up straight and ride with my knees pointing out – I
must have looked&nbsp;ridiculous!</p>
<p>The road through South Park is a very strange one. All the way along
there are roads going off the main one, but they lead nowhere. There
were obviously plans to develop the land and build ranches along there,
but the plans had clearly not worked out. There was even a kids play
park and baseball diamond all ready for the new inhabitants to use, but
I doubt if they had ever been tried out, and given the current climate,
it will be a while before anyone starts buying up the&nbsp;land.</p>
<p>After twenty something miles into the wind, we arrived in Hartsel but
found that the pub was no longer serving food and there was no campsite
there either. That was a little bit strange as the guidebook recommends
this as a place to end the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We stocked up with food and drink at the gas station and set off into
the wind again to find ourselves a place to sleep by the side of the
road. We got a great spot in the middle of nowhere and got our camp set
up for the&nbsp;night.</p>
<p><strong>July 14<br />
Day Twenty Six – Hartsel to Doyle ville – 97 miles – 1,950 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>The map seemed to suggest a fairly flat start to the day, but on the
ground it didn&#8217;t seem that way. I found the going pretty slow and it
wasn&#8217;t long before Marco was away in the&nbsp;distance.</p>
<p>By now I was very used to being alone in the big wide open spaces of
South Park and wasn&#8217;t disheartened by being able to see the trial
winding its way across the land for miles and miles ahead of me. This
morning though, I needed a little bit of help and so plugged in the Ipod
and that seemed to give me something else to think about as I made my
way towards the first climb of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>The steep section to the top of the climb had me pushing again,
something that I had been doing less and less over the past few days.
Maybe I was getting fitter after&nbsp;all?!</p>
<p>More stunning views were waiting at the top and just got better and
better as I began to descend towards Salida. In the space of about
fifteen miles, the trail dropped almost 3,000ft (nearly 1,000 metres)
and the temperature down in Salida was incredible – so much hotter than
we&#8217;d experienced over the previous few&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>We had a huge lunch and then stocked up on food for the coming few days
before I set off and Marco headed to the library again. This time he was
photocopying maps as we had been unable to buy a second set in any of
the towns we&#8217;d visited in the past week or&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>The headwind out of Salida was incredible as I zigzagged my way along
small county roads towards Poncha Springs and then on towards Marshall
Pass, some 25 miles and almost 4,000 feet of climbing&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>The first section was along the highway and the heat coming up off the
road was incredible. We were riding in the hottest part of the day too,
which clearly didn&#8217;t help. Off of the highway, the trail just kept on
going up and up and&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>There was an alternative route marked on the map, but unlike all the
others along the way, this one was shorter, steeper and rougher than the
main one; naturally, Marco was interested. He caught me up just before
the turning and we agreed to meet at the bottom of the hill on the other
side in&nbsp;Sargents.</p>
<p>I passed him a few minutes later – his chain had broken again and he was
struggling to get it fixed. He told me to carry on, and so I did just
that, knowing that I couldn&#8217;t really offer much help&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The trail used to be rail line up over the pass, and so the gradient was
not too steep but it just kept on going. Marco passed me again with
about seven miles to go to the top and I struggled on. The day just
seemed to be getting hotter, but luckily there were some shady sections
as I pedalled slowly along. My computer was ticking over very slowly, my
legs ached and I felt exhausted as I finally got a sight of the top, but
it was still some distance away. On I pushed and finally made it over
the&nbsp;top.</p>
<p>A bumpy and rocky downhill followed, and within another hour I saw
Sargents ahead of me, where I hoped to be able to get some food and
rest. The wind though did its best to stop me getting there, blowing
strongly into my face, making the final few miles pretty&nbsp;tough.</p>
<p>I arrived in Sargents to find the pub just about open and some food had
already been ordered for me. We scoffed down a couple of burgers each
and bought more supplies from the store next door before hitting the
road again. I wanted to just stay the night in Sargents, but looked at
the map and saw that the next section was about thirteen miles of
downhill along the highway. The light was fading as the sun began to
set, but I knew it wouldn&#8217;t take us too long to find a place to camp
once we turned off onto the gravel road&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>We rode as the sunset lit up the valley and pitched our tents in the
dark. I was extremely tired after the long climb, but knew that more of
the same lay ahead of&nbsp;us.</p>
<p><strong>July 15<br />
Day Twenty Seven – Doyle ville to Del Norte – 96 miles – 2,046 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Waking up in the middle of nowhere was rapidly becoming one of my
favourite aspects of the trip and today, waking up was an absolute
pleasure. The sunrise was great, but I knew that I couldn&#8217;t hang around
today, as we had two passes to get over before reaching the next town of
Del Norte, almost 100 miles&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>I set off a little while before Marco but he caught me up after after
about fifteen miles as I had stopped to chat with a motorcyclist who was
also riding the route. He told us that he had cycled some of the route
many years ago, and again issued another warning about New Mexico. All
these horror stories weren&#8217;t helping very&nbsp;much!</p>
<p>The trail up to Cochetopa Pass was pretty good and I was making good
time and got to the top without having to push – a good sign. I met
Marco at the top as he was just finishing his first lunch. He set off
and I followed shortly afterwards, hoping not to fall too far behind&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>An easy downhill section followed and then we had a short section on the
highway. The heat coming off the road was once again amazing ad I was
happy to get off the pavement and onto the next section of gravel&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>I found a little creek and some shade and set about filtering some water
and eating some lunch. The water filtering didn&#8217;t start too well as I
stood at the edge of the water on what looked like solid ground. It
wasn&#8217;t very solid and I got myself a wet and muddy foot for my troubles.
By the time I&#8217;d got the water filtered, the mosquitoes had arrived and
so I didn&#8217;t hang&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>I rode on through the heat of the day and finally made it up to Carnero
Pass where I finally stopped for a big feed before starting a good long
descent towards Del Norte. After about twenty miles, I rode off route
for a mile or so and paid a visit to the store at La&nbsp;Garita.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, I had arrived too late for hot food, but the very kind
shopkeeper said that she could make me a sandwich if I wanted one? I had
the best roast beef and horseradish sandwich ever and was soon back on
my&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>I was making great progress and had less than 20 miles to go to Del
Norte, but I soon slowed down as the tracks became more and more
primitive. I was riding through an amazing canyon-esque landscape though
and so I wasn&#8217;t too worried about slowing down until the trail turned
into tricky&nbsp;singletrack.</p>
<p>As I was tired, I found this section really tricky and I got slower and
slower the further I went. Up ahead, I saw a biker riding towards me and
for a moment I thought it was Marco. It turned out to be Alan from
California who was also riding part of the trail. He was taking a rest
day in Del Norte and was just riding back over a bit of the route to go
and visit a natural arch, a few miles away. We chatted for a while and
agreed to meet up later and possibly ride together for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>We went our separate ways and the trail continued to deteriorate before
I finally made it up to the high point, from which I could see Del Norte
ahead of me. This area was clearly used by the local youth as beer
bottle and cans littered the route, as did all kinds of other rubbish.
Most of it had been shot at as well – not such a nice place to ride&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>The trail turned to sand and once again I found myself pushing for a
while before riding the last section into town and along to the house of
Gary and Patti, a couple of local bikers who open their doors to Great
Divide riders for the night. It&#8217;s a real haven on the route and they are
so very welcoming to&nbsp;bikers.</p>
<p>I took a shower and then Marco, Alan and I headed to the local
restaurant for a bite to eat, before crawling into bed. Tomorrow, we
would face Indiana Pass, the highest point on the route. It was going to
be a tough&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>July 16<br />
Day Twenty Eight – Del Norte to Horca – 67 miles – 2,113 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have the best night&#8217;s sleep, thanks to being pretty
apprehensive about the climb up and over Indiana Pass that lay ahead of
us. The wind was blowing strongly throughout the night too, and it was
still blowing when we woke up – not a good&nbsp;sign.</p>
<p>After coffee and chatting, we got the bikes packed, thanked Gary and
Patti for their great hospitality, and headed out for&nbsp;breakfast.</p>
<p>We met Alan at the cafe and after filling up on bacon and eggs, we set
off towrds the hill that had been occupying my thoughts for most of the
night before, Indiana&nbsp;Pass.</p>
<p>The first ten miles were fairly gentle and we climbed just under 1,000
feet in that time. And then the paved road became a gravel road, and
things changed. The trail immediately became steeper and I knew that
this was the start of the biggest test so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>I took a little rest at the bottom, composed myself and then set off,
knowing that it was going to be uphill like this for the next thirteen
miles. We would have to climb another 3,000 feet before reaching the&nbsp;top.</p>
<p>I was determined to keep riding and desperately wanted to make it
without pushing. There were a few sections where I thought I would have
to push, but I just stopped, took a rest and then set off again. At one
point, I did get off the bike, and assumed the Superman position, (head
down, arms stretched) and got ready to push but managed to stop&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>Of course, Marco was long gone, but I kept pretty close to Alan and when
I saw him go over the top, I knew I had nearly done&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Crossing the pass was a huge relief but I was devastated to see that
there wasn&#8217;t even a sign to mark the achievement. We were at the high
point of the route, (11,910ft / 3,600m) and I couldn&#8217;t get a photo to
prove&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I carried on over the top, expecting to see the others waiting for me at
the side of the trail, but I didn&#8217;t see them anywhere. I finally caught
up with Alan at the aptly named Summitville, home to some very read
mountains and polluted water (thanks to all the&nbsp;mining).</p>
<p>We stopped and had a bite to eat and then spotted Marco riding towards
us. He had been sitting waiting for us a little way off the track at the
pass. I hadn&#8217;t heard him calling me as I had my headphones in to help me
over the&nbsp;top!</p>
<p>After lunch, the trail continued up and over the much shorter climb of
Stunner Pass and then down the other side to Platoro, where we filled up
on food once again. I was ready to stop for the night, even though it
was still pretty early, but the others wanted to carry on, and as it was
downhill it made&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>We rode for about five or six miles and then as I was pushing hard to
get up a bit of a hill, I overstretched my calf and wasn&#8217;t able to pedal
properly. I was in a bit of pain, but carried on anyway, hopeful that we
would make to the next settlement of&nbsp;Horca.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t quite make it, and Alan and I decided to call it a day at a
campground about eight miles before Horca. Marco was feeling strong (no
surprise there) and we agreed to try to meet him in El Rito the
following night. That would make it a very long day of some 110 miles,
but we thought we &#8216;d be able to do it. After all, we&#8217;d made it to the
high point so it would all be downhill from now on,&nbsp;right?!</p>
