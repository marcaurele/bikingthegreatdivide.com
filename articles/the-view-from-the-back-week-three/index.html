                <p><strong>July 3<br />
Day Fifteen – Squirrel Creek Campground to Jackson – 94 miles – 1,101
miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have the best night&#8217;s sleep – it was pretty warm in the tent
which didn&#8217;t help, I&#8217;m sure. We woke up and got packed away in time for
a fantastic breakfast – just what we both needed. I was feeling much
much better, even despite the poor night&#8217;s&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p>We got out onto the gravel road nice and early and the weather was
pretty good for us, a little cooler than the previous couple of days. I
felt like I was racing along, but Marco was still up ahead of me as we
crossed over the state border out of Idaho and into&nbsp;Wyoming.</p>
<p>The trail was in good condition until we started to climb up along the
edge of Yellowstone National Park. I kept my eyes out for bears, but
didn&#8217;t spot any, perhaps they were staying out of the way of the
mosquitoes that were swarming all around us and feasting on our&nbsp;flesh.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>We stopped for a short break alongside the Grassy Lake Reservoir, but
couldn&#8217;t hang around too long for fear of being eaten alive! After a
steep climb, the trail flattened out a bit and then we descended down to
Flagg Ranch, where we got a drink and a bite to eat, having completed
about 35 miles in double quick&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>At the ranch, we met group of cyclists who were riding the TransAmerica
trail; a 4,000 plus mile ride from Oregon to Virginia. It was
interesting to hear their tales from the road and they seemed pretty
interested In our route&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>We had a big hill to climb coming out of the ranch, but it was along the
paved road, which made it a little easier on the legs. Down the other
side, we had great views over Jackson Lake, which we rode around the
edge&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>We arrived at Colter Bay Village in the bright sunshine and sat outside
the gas station eating sandwiches as we decided what to do next. We had
hoped to meet back up with Ollie here, but received a text message that
suggested he was going to carry on without us. We decided then that we
would take a diversion off the route down to the town of Jackson. It
would take us 40 miles off of the route, but we&#8217;d heard that the road
down to the town was supposed to be amazing. We would also be able to
buy supplies and parts for the bikes, and maybe even have a rest day. I
was pretty keen on this, and the idea grew on Marco as we went down the
road to&nbsp;Jackson.</p>
<p>The ride alongside Jackson Lake with the Teton Mountains behind it, was
simply stunning. We stopped many times to take photos of the amazing
scenery, especially near Jenny&nbsp;Lake.</p>
<p>In the small village of Moose, we stopped for a cool drink and Marco
started to feel pretty unwell – it seemed as though he had the same
thing that I had had a few days earlier – not&nbsp;pleasant.</p>
<p>The weather began to close in a bit and we saw some lightning in the
distance and so decided to take the slightly shorter route into Jackson,
straight along the main highway. We got almost all the way into town
before the rain came pouring down, but were able to take shelter in the
information&nbsp;centre.</p>
<p>We found ourselves a motel room in town (no mean feat as the place was
full of people here for the 4th July weekend) and rode through the rain
to get there. We had to wait for the owners to show up and Marco got
worse the longer we waited. By the time we got the room key, Marco was
in bad shape and felt very ill, so took a shower and went straight to&nbsp;bed.</p>
<p><strong>July 4<br />
Day Sixteen – Jackson Rest&nbsp;Day</strong></p>
<p>Marco woke up feeling better, but still not 100% and so we decided to
take the whole day off. We spent the day visiting bike shops, picking up
spares, got our laundry done and cleaned and fixed up the bikes. I also
bought a tent as we decided that it would be better for us to have a
tent each, especially as it got warmer as we travelled further&nbsp;south.</p>
<p><strong>July 5<br />
Day Seventeen – Jackson to Union Pass – 91 miles – 1,192 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">After a rest the day before, it was
good to be back on the bike again. That might be an odd thing to say,
and it felt a bit weird at the time too! The feeling didn&#8217;t last very
long though, as within 20 minutes I had to stop at the side of the road
to fix a&nbsp;flat!</span></strong></p>
<p>Once that was fixed, we set off along the road again. The bad thing
about taking the diversion off the route was that we had to ride back
much the same way to get back on track. The road was still pretty
awesome though, even if it was steady uphill all the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>We took an early lunch at a lovely little cafe with views of the
mountains and then got back on our way. All morning, I&#8217;d had the feeling
that I was fighting the bike a little bit and my newly-fitted brake pads
were rubbing against the brake disc, meaning that I had to work harder.
I&#8217;d thought that they would ease up the further we went, but it soon
became apparent that they were still pretty&nbsp;tight.</p>
<p>We stopped and tried to fix the brakes and ended up putting the old pads
back on which made things a little&nbsp;easier.</p>
<p>We turned back on to the road and began to climb up over Togwotee Pass.
The road was being repaired and was not in such a great state, but we
made it to the top and then began a steep technical downhill section,
which I really struggled with. The reward was a stunning view of the
mountains and a short section through a beautiful deep&nbsp;canyon.</p>
<p>A downhill section on the road took us to a campground and <span class="caps">RV</span> park where
we stopped for a barbecue dinner, complete with live&nbsp;entertainment.</p>
<p>Then it was back onto the road for a long, steep climb up towards Union
Pass, as the sun was going down. The views were simply amazing, but
because it was getting darker and darker, we couldn&#8217;t hang around for
too&nbsp;long.</p>
<p>We arrived at the top of the hill in the dark and rode a couple of miles
to a primitive campground. Pitching my new tent in the dark wasn&#8217;t too
easy (thank goodness I&#8217;d practiced in the motel room!) but we got set up
and into bed quickly, happy with the day&#8217;s&nbsp;mileage.</p>
<p><strong>July 6<br />
Day Eighteen – Union Pass to Boulder – 90 miles – 1,282 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>We had a bit of a disturbed sleep, thanks to so inquisitive cows getting
a bit too close to Marco&#8217;s tent for comfort. He woke in a panic,
thinking that a bear was sniffing around and in turn, woke me by
shouting at the&nbsp;cows!</p>
<p>We were up very early and ate breakfast sheltering from the early
morning chill in the&nbsp;toilet!</p>
<p>We started with another steep climb up over Union Pass, which had us
stripping off our warm clothing very quickly. We then had a long section
of undulating track before we reached the paved road again. We had to
ride through a bit of a storm first though. I was knocked off my bike by
a strong gust of wind that came from nowhere. I managed to get my feet
unclipped and escaped without any injury, but the wind got stronger and
more consistent and by the time I reached a roadside cafe, I was pretty
tired and looked forward to a big&nbsp;feed.</p>
<p>Whilst I was in the bathroom, a large storm started raging outside, with
rain pouring down and soaking the horses that were tied up next to our
bikes. If I&#8217;d been ten minutes later, I would have been completely&nbsp;drenched!</p>
<p>We had a long road section next, but fortunately the rain had stopped.
The wind however was blowing strongly as we undulated our way to
Pinedale, where an amazing coincidence awaited&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>Before leaving Banff, we had sent a number of requests for places to
stay via the website couchsurfing. As we rode into Pinedale, I had the
thought that we had made a request for somewhere to stay here, but we
hadn&#8217;t seen a reply -the lack of internet access hadn&#8217;t helped&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>We stopped off in the outdoor shop in Pinedale and picked up some
supplies before we got chatting to a local biker who recommended the
local pub as a good place to eat – we were desperate for some pasta – so
we went along. We were met at the door by Amy, who recognised us from
our couchsurfing request and website. She was our host and had accepted
our request for a place to stay, but we hadn&#8217;t seen the email
confirmation. What an amazing&nbsp;coincidence!</p>
<p>It turned out that the pub had no pasta, so we went back up the road to
a pasta and pizza place to carbo load. It turned out that Amy (and Joe)
were staying in a cabin on a campground along the road to Boulder, which
happened to be on our&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>We rode the 15 miles or so to Boulder in the dark along the highway –
possibly the scariest and most dangerous part of the route – and got a
shower and headed to bed after a long chat with&nbsp;Joe.</p>
<p><strong>July 7<br />
Day Nineteen – Boulder to Atlantic City – 101 miles – 1,383 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Joe woke up early to see us off and we coasted the couple of miles into
Boulder where we stopped and had some breakfast and stocked up on snacks
and drinks for the day. We also had a look at the route for the day and
prepared for an uphill&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Despite being uphill most of the way, I think this was one of my
favourite days of the trail. We rode up into a huge basin, with vast
expanses of flat(ish) land all around us, framed by the Continental
Divide inn the distance. It was a very special place to be riding&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>We made good progress and took an early first lunch before starting on a
long section of rollercoaster-like trail. It was a little daunting to
ride to the top of a rise and look up to see the trail stretching ahead
as far as the eye could see, up and down all the way. But I just got
myself into a positive frame of mind and decided that I was going to
ride all of the ups and downs, riding hard down hill to try and coast up
the other side as much as I&nbsp;could.</p>
<p>We climbed up and on to the Divide and then rode along the top of it for
a couple of miles, giving superb views out across the basin. There was
hardly a cloud in the sky and we saw almost no other people for the
whole&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>We had a short section on the road before taking the trail up to South
Pass City, which was little more than a small village. We took a bit of
a rest in the shade and filled up with ice lollies and cold drinks
before the short up and down ride to Atlantic&nbsp;City.</p>
<p>In Atlantic City (again, only a village) we ate a good dinner and
ordered some pizza and pancakes to go. We also filled up all our bottles
with water, as we were heading into the desert and wouldn&#8217;t have a
reliable water source until we got to Rawlins, some 120 miles&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>We made a foolish map reading error coming out of Atlantic City and
started to climb the wrong hill. We only went about half a mile out of
our way though, and had to ride back through the village, hoping that
nobody noticed that we&#8217;d gone the wrong&nbsp;way!</p>
<p>The correct hill was ridiculously steep and I had no other choice than
to push up to the top, but from the top, we had a great long section of
downhill ahead of us. We had entered the red desert which was looking
exceptionally beautiful in the evening&nbsp;sunlight.</p>
<p>We were however, battling with a side wind which seemed to grab hold of
the trailer and flag and making the bike feel very unstable. The track
was also a tricky one to ride along, as it was very bumpy and
washboarded indeed. My hands were very sore from the jarring of the
handlebars and the loss of sensation in them was starting to give me
real&nbsp;concerns.</p>
<p>We rode on until the sunset and set up our camp by the side of the
trail, where we munched down a bit of the pizza we&#8217;d carried from
Atlantic City. A fantastic way to end an fantastic day; a 100-miler&nbsp;too!</p>
<p><strong>July 8<br />
Day Twenty – Atlantic City to Rawlins – 112 miles – 1,495 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Waking up in the desert was simply wonderful. We felt as though we were
in the middle of nowhere, which I guess wasn&#8217;t too far from the truth.
Our target for the day was to be the town of Rawlins, over 100 miles
away. The last 30 miles or so would be on the road though, which in our
minds made things a little&nbsp;easier.</p>
<p>The trail was bumpy but otherwise pretty good. Heavy trucks had clearly
been using the roads though, as their tracks were visible throughout the
day. We saw a few of them along the way, serving the mining that seemed
to be taking over sections of the desert. We were lucky that the weather
was dry, and had been for a few days – it would have been very hard
going if the trail was wet and&nbsp;muddy.</p>
<p>Marco went on ahead, which was pretty normal, and I carried on behind.
We&#8217;d split up like this several times before, with Marco leaving signs
for me at any turnings off the main track. We only had one set of maps
between us, which in hindsight was a&nbsp;mistake.</p>
<p>I started up a slight drag of a hill when things suddenly got very hard
for me, the back wheel started to drag. I&#8217;d picked up a flat and would
have to stop to try and fix it. This flat coincided with the wind
picking up, blowing the sand&nbsp;everywhere.</p>
<p>Rather than just changing the tube, I decided that it would make sense
for me to change the actual tyre as well. It was starting to get very
worn indeed, and I&#8217;d picked up a spare in Jackson on our rest&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>I unhitched the trailer and got the back wheel off, found the puncture
in the tube and got that changed before starting on the tyre. As hard as
I tried, I couldn&#8217;t get the new tyre onto the rim – the fit was so
tight, and it looked like it would never go on. With the sand still
blowing all over the place and my patience running out, I gave up and
put the old tyre back&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>All this had taken me ages and I was conscious that Marco would be
waiting up ahead somewhere, so I tried to push on and catch him up. I
think that was why I missed Marco&#8217;s sign on the road. He left a load of
arrows marked in the sand, but somehow I didn&#8217;t see them and carried on,
oblivious to the fact I&#8217;d taken the wrong&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>The trail was fairly rollercoaster-like and the surface was pretty sandy
and tough going. Worryingly, I couldn&#8217;t see Marco&#8217;s tracks ahead of me,
but the surface was such that there were hardly any tracks on there at
all. I even looked back behind to see if I was making a track, and when
I saw that I wasn&#8217;t, I carried on, pretty sure I was going the right&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>The feeling didn&#8217;t last though, and the further I went, the more sure I
was that I&#8217;d gone wrong somewhere and when I reached the next junction,
I stopped and dug out the guide book that was safely in the bottom of my
trailer&nbsp;bag.</p>
<p>Here I found the news that I really didn&#8217;t want to see. I was way off
course and had missed a turning just after fixing my flat. Fortunately,
rescue was close at hand! I got chatting to Ed, an old fella working on
the road and he offered to give me a lift back on to the correct track.
It turned out I&#8217;d ridden about 15 miles down the wrong road and whilst I
could have carried on and joined back up with the correct route fairly
easily, I knew that Marco would be waiting for me somewhere along the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>We found Marco by the side of the trail, underneath his space blanket,
sheltering from the sun which was beating down on us. I thanked Ed for
rescuing me and we got back onto the correct trail, heading for&nbsp;Rawlins.</p>
<p>More undulations took us down to the main road, which took us down
towards Rawlins. It wasn&#8217;t downhill all the way though, as there was a
huge climb up over the Continental Divide before going down again into&nbsp;Rawlins.</p>
<p>My legs were dead by the time I rolled into town, and the food couldn&#8217;t
come out quick enough. We rode to the campground in the dark and got to
bed as quickly as we could. Another 100 mile day under our belts and
although the desert had tried its hardest to beat us, we had survived
another&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>July 9<br />
Day Twenty One – Rawlins to Slater – 86 miles – 1,581 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>After a good sleep, we were up and away from the campsite early and
found our way to a local cafe for a good breakfast. We needed to stock
up on groceries though, and so while Marco headed to the supermarket, I
set off on the road, knowing that I would be caught before too&nbsp;long.</p>
<p>In fact, I made pretty good time and reached the end of the paved road
before Marco caught me up – the supplies had obviously slowed him&nbsp;down!</p>
<p>We started up a massive steep hill, pausing only to chat to a walker who
had stopped by the side of the road. He was walking part of the
Continental Divide Trail and was running low on water, so we helped him&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Back on the hill, the trail just kept going up and up and up and by the
time we crossed over Middlewood Hill, it was definitely time for a first
lunch. The afternoon turned out to be very hard work. A quite gravelly
road was made more tricky by the constant headwind and occasional side
wind gusts. I remember very clearly shouting out in annoyance at having
to pedal downhill, just to keep&nbsp;going!</p>
<p>The road did however take us out of the open and back into the slight
shade of the forest, which came as a very welcome relief. We&#8217;d been out
in the open for several days now meaning that both the heat and the wind
had made things hard for us. At least now we got a little respite from
the&nbsp;elements.</p>
<p>By the time I caught back up with Marco, he had eaten his second lunch
and filtered a load of water. I quickly ate my lunch and drank down some
water before starting back on my way. Little did I know that I was
entering a section that would test me to my limits. Fifteen miles
downhill on the paved road sounds easy enough and in my mind I was
looking forward to not having to pedal too hard for a little while. The
maps don&#8217;t tell you anything about the headwind though, and the downhill
never really felt like downhill – I never got any real speed up and
definitely didn&#8217;t coast down the&nbsp;hill.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill, I crossed the border from Wyoming into
Colorada, but barely took any notice of the sign, I was so tired. I
found Marco in the shade just off the side of the road and hoped that he
would say that he&#8217;d found it tough down the hill too. He hadn&#8217;t. I was
dead on my feet and wanted nothing more than to just stop right there
for the night, but Marco wanted to push on further. I knew it was the
right thing to do, but didn&#8217;t think my legs would take me much&nbsp;further.</p>
<p>We managed just about six or seven miles along the road before Marco
found us a good place to camp for the night. Exhausted, we got the tents
up and got the dinner cooked – pasta and tomato sauce – hardly a luxury
meal, but it tasted great right&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>I went to bed frustrated that we hadn&#8217;t got as far as we wanted to that
day, but was looking forward to a shorter and hopefully, easier day&nbsp;ahead.</p>
