                <p><strong>July 17<br />
Day Twenty Nine – Horca to Hopewell Lake – 71 miles – 2,184 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Alan and I woke to a very cold and damp morning, but it was dry at
least. The good news was that my calf was feeling <span class="caps">OK</span>. A bag of ice from
the camp host certainly helped the healing the evening&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>We ate breakfast, packed and got back onto the trail, wondering if we
were going to a) make it to El Rito and b) ever see Marco&nbsp;again.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The trail took us further down the valley, alongside the
Conejos (Rabbits) River towards Horca. It was really cold and I couldn&#8217;t
find my warm gloves, meaning that my fingers were absolutely frozen by
the time we arrived at the local store, where the sun had finally
reached. We&#8217;d heard that we shouldn&#8217;t rely on the store in Horca; it is
run by an old woman who apparently has quite a flexible approach to
opening hours. As we were looking for a nice hot cup of coffee, the
store was&nbsp;closed!</p>
<p>The sun was now out and my hands began to warm up as we started the
climb up to La Manga pass. Getting to the top entailed climbing for
about six miles along the paved road. The first section was pretty steep
and I wasn&#8217;t sure that I would make it all the way, but it soon eased
off a bit and became easy enough to&nbsp;climb.</p>
<p>I was first to the top and had a chance to take a rest with a view over
a wide basin in the morning sunlight – a really good start to the day;
our last in&nbsp;Colorado.</p>
<p>When Alan caught me up, we set off down a nice steady hill before taking
a turn off the pavement and onto a gravel road, crossing the narrow
gauge tracks of the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic railway. We passed over
into New Mexico and after the obligatory photos at the border sign, we
started back up hill&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, the track condition deteriorated and our progress
slowed dramatically. The next ten miles or so seemed to take us for ever
and after a short steep section of unrideable stony ground (even Marco
had to push up it, we found out later) we took a lunch break looking out
over the Cruces Basin&nbsp;Wilderness.</p>
<p>The trail improved for a while, but soon became rough again and we both
began to feel very tired. We had made it back up to around 11,000 feet
too, which certainly made things feel tougher. We knew by now that there
was no chance of making it to El Rito that day and that maybe meant that
we wouldn&#8217;t be seeing Marco again. By now, we were heading slightly
downhill, but it really didn&#8217;t feel like it and every small section of
uphill was testing us. The other problem was that we were now heading
into the hottest part of the day and typically, we had very little shade
to protect us from the heat of the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>We took a short break under the shade of a tree just as soon as we could
and as we were setting off again, a car pulled up alongside us and a
couple got out. The guy immediately opened up the boot and got out a
huge container of water and filled our bottles for us. We chatted away
for a while and it turned out that he had just ridden the Colorado Trail
and thought that we&#8217;d appreciate some extra drinks. He wasn&#8217;t wrong! We
had enough water for the day, but having some extra was a great help.
They had also seen Marco earlier in the day and confirmed that we
wouldn&#8217;t be catching him up&nbsp;today!</p>
<p>Another short (but slow) climb was followed by a nice downhill section
which took us to another highway. Alan was just about ready to quit for
the day, and even though I was feeling tired, I thought it would be
better for us to get up the next hill to the&nbsp;campground.</p>
<p>It seemed like a role-reversal of sorts; normally it was me that wanted
to stop early and Marco would convince me to carry on for a while. Alan
agrreed that it made sense to keep going and so we started to make our
way up the&nbsp;hill.</p>
<p>It was a real slog; we were both really tired after all the climbing the
day before and those five miles seemed to take forever. To make things
worse, there were quite a few cars and RVs racing past us up the hill
and I started to worry that the campsite would be full for the weekend –
that wouldn&#8217;t have gone down well, I&#8217;m&nbsp;sure!</p>
<p>Finally, we made it to the top of the hill and into the campsite where
we could relax in the last bit of sun of the day. It had been a
gruelling day, and we were both pretty dead on our&nbsp;feet.</p>
<p>I ate loads that evening, wolfing down two dried meals as well as some
left over sandwiches from lunch time. It didn&#8217;t take long for me to fall
asleep that night either – it had been a tough few&nbsp;days.</p>
<p><strong>July 18<br />
Day Thirty – Hopewell Lake to Polvadera Mesa – 81 miles – 2,265 miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>Day Thirty started with some more climbing; but within less than a mile,
we were riding downhill again for a mile or two before starting up to
the top of Burned Mountain. Just a mile or so later and we were over the
top and heading downhill again. Some undulating track followed before a
steep downhill section took us back onto the tarmac just outside the
settlement of Canon&nbsp;Plaza.</p>
<p>The road continued on down to Vallecitos, where we met and chatted with
some locals before heading off the road again, chased by what seemed
like hundreds of local dogs. Like many other small settlements, it
seemed that the dogs outnumbered the people by about five to&nbsp;one!</p>
<p>As the day got warmer, we climbed up through some more forest before
beginning the downhill section into El Rito. We&#8217;d hoped to make it here
the day before and somehow, El Rito had been given some kind of mystical
quality in our minds. In reality, it was a tiny place with a little
local store and one restaurant. Unfortunately, the restaurant was
closed, as the owners were out of town at a family wedding – just our&nbsp;luck!</p>
<p>We filled up on drinks and had some snacks before hitting the road
towards the next town on our route, Abiquiu. It was downhill all the way
but of course it wasn&#8217;t as simple as it could have been as the wind had
started to blow. Naturally, we had to ride directly into&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>It was amazing though – we had really arrived in New Mexico and the
scenery was more incredible than I thought it would be. The road took us
through a huge expanse of land. The sky was bigger than we&#8217;d seen since
Montana and the horizon was peppered with giant rocky outcrops. The heat
was tempered only by the warm wind that blew into our faces as we rode
the 18 miles into&nbsp;Abiquiu.</p>
<p>We found refuge from the sun in the local store and cafe, where we both
ate our way through a couple of freshly made sandwiches and lots of
drinks. Whilst we were sat there, we chatted away with a couple of the
other customers who had also completed the ride in the past. They shared
tales from the trail and once again, I heard horror stories from New
Mexico; countless punctures or inpenetrable mud tracks seem to be the
clearest memories for everyone that has ridden the&nbsp;trail.</p>
<p>We got news from Marco in the store too. He had been there earlier in
the day and left a message that he would see us in Cuba, another 80
miles away. We filled up on supplies for the coming couple of days
before walking out of the cool store, out into the heat of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d packed the bikes up and I was just getting on, when I noticed that
my front tyre was completely flat. I couldn&#8217;t believe it! I&#8217;d obviously
run over something on the road and the tyre had been deflating all the
time we&#8217;d been&nbsp;inside.</p>
<p>We got that fixed and then set off into some of the hardest sections of
the route, although we didn&#8217;t really realise how tough it was going to&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>The trail quickly became pretty rough and heavily washboarded. Climbing
over the bumpy surface was doubly hard. Not only did we have to get up
the hills, but each groove of the surface was like another hill to be&nbsp;climbed.</p>
<p>On and on we climbed before reaching a huge plain, with giant mountains
ahead of us. Also ahead was a giant thunderstorm, complete with very
black clouds and an occasional fork of lightning to boot. At least the
plain was flat for a&nbsp;while!</p>
<p>We took a right turn and headed straight towards the mountains and the
storm, apprehensive about both. The climb started out quite gently but
that didn&#8217;t last long as the path became rougher and rougher. Huge slabs
of lava rock were interspersed with fine volcanic sand sections, making
progress very uncomfortable and very slow&nbsp;indeed.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the storm seemed to have passed us by and we didn&#8217;t even get
wet. The sun was getting lower and lower in the sky and it seemed to be
moving towards the horizon quicker than we were getting towards our
chosen camp spot for the night, somewhere in the Polvadera&nbsp;Mesa.</p>
<p>It continued to get darker and darker and by the time we reached the
mile mark where our map told us there was a good campsite, the light was
almost completely gone. It wasn&#8217;t obvious where this great camping spot
was, so we found a decent clearing in the forest and hastily got the
tents up before making and eating tortillas by&nbsp;torchlight.</p>
<p>By now, we&#8217;d realised that water was going to be a little bit of a
problem. We hadn&#8217;t crossed any water since we&#8217;d left Abiquiu and due to
the heat and the climbing, we&#8217;d drunk quite a bit that afternoon. We
were so concerned that when we were woken by some rain in the night, we
both got out of our tents to put our water bottles out to try and catch
some of the rain water in&nbsp;them!</p>
<p><strong>July 19<br />
Day Thirty One – Polvadera Mesa to Just Past Cuba – 68 miles – 2,333
miles&nbsp;total</strong></p>
<p>It was a very rough night indeed; the wind howled all night and the rain
started and stopped over and over again, but didn&#8217;t amount to much. I
felt more tired when I got up than I had done when I crawled into my
sleeping bag the night before. It was dark; the alarm had been set half
an hour earlier than usual and so it was only just about light by the
time we set off along the forest&nbsp;track.</p>
<p>The surface was pretty good to start with, as we continued to climb, but
that soon came to an end and we were back to rough trails, making
progress predictably, and frustratingly, slow. Finally, we reached the
high point, but only after a long section of steep and unrideable tracks
had made us both get off and&nbsp;push.</p>
<p>Over the top, the surface improved a little and our pace returned to
something like normal for a while before we started on a very steep,
very rocky descent. Alan&#8217;s superior biking skills meant that he soon
caught and overtook me on the technical section and arrived at the
abandoned car first; somebody had driven in to this point and had either
got stuck in the mud or just run out of gas, leaving their car sideways
across the&nbsp;track.</p>
<p>We stopped at a couple of cattle tanks to see if there was any water in
them, but had no luck. Oour supplies were running down and we were
starting to get a bit&nbsp;concerned.</p>
<p>The trail took us on into a large, open park and as we rode through, I
spotted a lake up ahead and so we stopped and filtered some water to
fill up our bottles. By now the heat was starting to rise and my energy
was starting to run out. Another long steady climb didn&#8217;t help much
either and so as soon as we found a creek with running water, we stopped
for a rest and some lunch. I made up the tortillas, whilst Alan went to
the creek and filled up our bottles with good clean water (the lake
water hadn&#8217;t been the&nbsp;best!).</p>
<p>After a good rest, we set off on a track that zig-zagged along the side
of the mountain and took us through some hippy camps on towards the
highway. A big storm threatened to soak us, but passed us by as it moved
along the valley – another lucky&nbsp;escape!</p>
<p>We made it to the highway after a good fast downhill section and after a
short climb, it was downhill all the way into the town of Cuba. We
dropped over 2,000ft in about six or seven miles and the heat at the
lower altitude was&nbsp;incredible.</p>
<p>We rode through the town, looking for a bite to eat when I spotted
Marco&#8217;s bike and trailer outside the local grocery store – the team was
re-united! We all ate some spicy Mexican food and drank gallons of fresh
lemonade and caught up on tales from the trail over the past few days.
It was great to see Marco again and pleasing to learn that he had found
the past few days very hard too. In fact, I think that he&#8217;d had a
tougher time than us – the severity of the conditions had been a big
shock to him&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>We spent some time in the supermarket, stocking up on supplies before
trying to get a pizza to go. The pizza place was closed though and so we
had to make do with Subway. We parted company with Alan here; he was
heading off to explore some more of New Mexico, but we hoped to meet up
again in Grants in a couple of days&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Our trailers were heavier than they&#8217;d ever been before as we set off
towards the desert; loaded down with food and lots and lots of water.
The past couple of days had taught us that having enough water was going
to be a huge&nbsp;challenge.</p>
<p>With our heavy loads, we rode into the wind along the highway for about
ten miles, before taking a turn onto the gravel road that would take us
through the desert towards Grants. We stopped and made camp soon after
the turn, enjoying a large subway sandwich in the warm orange light of
the&nbsp;sunset.</p>
