</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This is the second of a series of ten posts about my recent trip to
Mountain Bike the Continental Divide between Banff, Canada to Antelope
Wells, New Mexico. <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2586/3746776986_10b4cc3ce2.jpg"></a></em></strong></p>
<p>I arrived late in Banff and in hindsight I should have had a days rest
and preparation before heading out on the trail. Instead, after I
arrived I stayed up late and with the help of the Simon and Marco put my
bike and trailer together and sorted out our&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1: Banff - Chester Lake Trailhead (43&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>Before starting the route I posted my bike bag and a few things that I
didn’t need on to Phoenix, Arizona. As with previous trip I posted my
stuff to the Greyhound Bus Terminal in Phoenix. Quite often people don’t
know that you can do this but actually as long as you are not in hurry
for your package to arrive, Greyhound is a pretty reliable service for
parcels and they specialise in taking oversized and overweight packages
(like bike&nbsp;bags).</p>
<p>We eventually got started at 10am – the first day did not go well for
me. I was exhausted from work, the trans-Atlantic flight and the sudden
change of routine. I think my traveling companions were annoyed with me,
perhaps thinking that I was un-fit and unprepared rather than just tired
from travel. This aside the scenery was varied an beautiful and I new
that we were going to be in for a real treat over the next&nbsp;month.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2586/3746776986_10b4cc3ce2.jpg" /></p>
<p>We stopped at about 7pm – I was happy to go on further but I was only
going at 6mph and I could sense the frustration of my slowness on Simon
and Marco. In any case we stopped, we ate, we hydrated and we slept – I
slept really well, catching up on vital hours of&nbsp;rest.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Chester Lake Trailhead - Elkford (66&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>Waking the next morning I felt a lot better and although I felt stronger
as I cycled out of the campsite this didn’t last long as I had a
puncture within about 15 minutes. Luckily the slime in my tires sealed
the hole and I was able to fix it relatively quickly.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The days riding was mainly on gravel backcountry roads and also
included our first Continental Divide Crossing as we ascended Elk Pass.
I’m not sure if it was because it was the first divide crossing but in
my head Elk Pass still rates as one of the hardest crossings of the
continental divide that we completed during our month&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;375&#8221; caption=&#8221;Elk Pass&#8221;]<img alt="Elk
Pass" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3487/3746793404_c34d72c9ef.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>During the decent from Elk Pass I got a blow out on my front tire which
sent me over my handlebars and crashing to the ground. Stupidly I had my
hands on my t-grips rather than my breaks during the decent but luckily
apart from a few minor scratches both my bike and I were relatively&nbsp;unharmed.</p>
<p>My luck continued to plummet as during the next decent both my water
bottles came flying out of my bottle cages and I didn’t notice until I
had got to the base of the hill. There was no way that I was going up to
retrieve them as I didn’t have a clue at which part of the two mile
decent they had decided to leave&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>I was also developing some sort of stomach bug and the saddle sores were
starting to get pretty&nbsp;big!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3512/3746032131_b4be13214c.jpg" /></p>
<p>That evening we camped at the Elkford Lions Club Camp Ground and had
pizza at a small café over the road. We made plans for the next day as
the route had changed. We decided that Marco (the mountain goat) would
take the new route. The new route (developed in 2009) involved a
mountain pass crossing and a section of hike-a-bike where as Simon and I
would stick to the original route and&nbsp;maps.</p>
<p>Back at the campsite we had a bit of gear sort to make sure that the two
teams could be self-sufficient over the next 48&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3: Elkford – Baynes Lake (78&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>There was no doubt about it I was feeling stronger and almost completely
recovered from the jet-lag, but I still really suffering from my stomach
bug which at times was incredibly&nbsp;painful.</p>
<p>Much of today’s route was on paved roads and gravel track. The best news
however was that apart from the 2 mile steep <em>‘killer’</em> climb out of
Elkford most of the route was&nbsp;downhill!</p>
<p>[<img alt="Titan" src="/images/2009/07/Titan-300x225.jpg" />][]After a couple of hours we stopped at the town of
<a href="http://www.britishcolumbia.com/regions/towns/?townID=3519">Sparwood</a> for a bite to eat. Sparwood was a mining town and at the
centre of the town was <strong><em>‘Titan’</em></strong>the worlds biggest truck that would
have been used at some point to extract coal from under the ground.
Sparwood was also the location where Marco headed off on the new route
for 24 hours. He didn’t complete the route due to poor weather and <a href="../?p=251">has
written an account of his experience here</a> – which reassures me that I
made the right decision not to go with&nbsp;him!</p>
<p>Simon and I continued to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernie,_British_Columbia">Fernie</a> – where we had another sandwich. On
the way Simon got a flat tire in his <span class="caps">BOB</span> trailer and changed it by the
side of the road. Little did we know that this would only be the start
of the problems with the <span class="caps">BOB</span> and the&nbsp;pump!</p>
<p>We were cycling well (although it was mostly downhill!) and I was keen
to make today from a psychological point of view my first 100 mile day.
However, in the end we decided to stop at the campsite at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baynes_Lake,_British_Columbia">Baynes
Lake</a> rather than pushing on the extra 24 miles to the next&nbsp;campsite.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2596/3746013999_5bedf0b748.jpg" /></p>
<p>The good thing about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baynes_Lake,_British_Columbia">Baynes Lake</a> campsite was that it had access
to the Internet and I was able to check on Marco’s location using the
<a href="http://international.findmespot.com/"><span class="caps">SPOT</span> <span class="caps">GPS</span> locator</a> that he was carrying. It was great to see that he
had made his target for the day – although he had a huge day ahead of
him to&nbsp;follow!</p>
<p>During the night it started to rain, and rain, and rain,&nbsp;and……rain!</p>
<p><strong>Day 4: Baynes Lake – Eureka (??&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3521/3746033561_c465b3e0e9_m.jpg" />It was cold when we woke up and still raining heavily. We got
moving fairly quickly and packed our stuff under the front of someone’s
trailer. We were just about to leave when we noticed that Simons <span class="caps">BOB</span>
wheel had gone down again. We pumped it up but five minutes later it was
down again. We changed the tube and pumped it up but again after a few
minutes it went down&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>It took us a while to work it out. But in the end we concluded it must
be a problem with the pump – it would only inflate the tire to a certain
air pressure and then it would deflate? Sort of options we managed to
find someone on the campsite who had an electric pump – we pumped up the
<span class="caps">BOB</span> and headed off <em>‘hand&nbsp;pump-less!’.</em></p>
<p>As we made our way towards the <span class="caps">US</span> border it continued to rain and we
sank into the mud on the forest tracks. We were also very nervous about
getting punctures as we would be un-able to fix them. Eventually we made
it to Grasmere where we enjoyed (well ate) some lumberjack sandwiches
and Simon threw his peanuts all over the floor of the shop which caused
the locals great&nbsp;amusement!</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;375&#8221; caption=&#8221;Heading to the
<span class="caps">US</span> Border&#8221;]<img alt="Heading to the US Border" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3746802104_6aa2cf54c1.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Continuing south we were now cycling through the Tobacco Plain Indian
Reservation. It got its name as the Native American Indians had once
grown tobacco on these lands. However, after the colonisation the
process was never able to be repeated by the white&nbsp;settlers.</p>
<p>We had a relatively easy border crossing at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosville,_British_Columbia">Roosville</a> despite the
rather grumpy boarder guard who was struggling to understand the
difference between green and&nbsp;read.</p>
<p>From the border we continued south to the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka,_Montana">Eureka</a> where we
had agreed to meet up with Marco. At Eureka we based ourselves at a
little café and waited, and waited and waited. I cycled down into the
town and managed to pick up the wifi signal from the local library
(which was shut) on my iPhone. I could see Marco’s location on the
<a href="http://international.findmespot.com/"><span class="caps">SPOT</span></a> and I took a few screen shots to show&nbsp;Simon.</p>
<p>I couple of hours later we re-checked his location and he hadn’t really
moved. Puzzled, we decided to book ourselves into a motel where would be
able to monitor his progress without huddling outside the library in the
rain! Eventually he started to move (in the wrong direction) <a href="../?p=251">see his
blog post for details</a> as
it sounded like a crazy day! Eventually he got to us at about 21.30h and
we were very pleased to see him and interested to hear about his&nbsp;adventures.</p>
