<p><strong><em>This is the third of a series of ten posts about my recent trip to
Mountain Bike the Continental Divide between Banff, Canada to Antelope
Wells, New Mexico. <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3746070079_36b5c55f92.jpg"></a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Day 5: Eureka – Upper Whitefish Lake (68&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>Day five was a significant turning point for me. I felt healthy, fit and
my stomach was felling a lot&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>The first part of today’s route was on pavement and we made fairly quick
progress over the first 20 miles before the real climbing began. As we
progressed upwards towards the Whitefish Divide I took it slowly but
chose to keep going rather than stop for short breaks. As a result I was
the first to arrive at the top of the divide and sat watching a bear
high up on the hill as I waited for the&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Decent from the
Whitefish Divide&#8221;]<img alt="Decent from the Whitefish Divide" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2553/3746838500_71ea868083.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>The decent from the Whitefish Divide was fantastic and we made swift
progress down towards the Ford Work Center before starting the next big
climb up towards Red Meadow Lake. By the time we arrived at Red Meadow
we were all pretty tired and Simon was keen to camp there for the night.
In the end we dropped the five miles back through the snowline to Upper
Whitefish Lake and found a fantastic&nbsp;campspot.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Upper Whitefish

<strong>Day 6: Upper Whitefish Lake - Swan Lake (96&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>I was a cold start to the morning with frost on the ground as we ate our
porridge before heading down the trail to the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefish,_Montana">Whitefish</a> (a
very cool little&nbsp;town!).</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Whitefish
Lake&#8221;]<img alt="Whitefish Lake" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2472/3746049817_dd64ac915d.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>We arrived at Whitefish at 10am and found the only open Café in town
where we enjoyed some fresh coffee and breakfast Burrito’s. I left the
guys in the café and headed to the <a href="http://www.glaciercyclery.com/">Whitefish Glacier Cyclery</a> – I had
been having problems with my gears for the last few days and Ron (the
shop owner) did a great job of getting my bike working properly again. I
also picked up some extra supplies at the shop including a full set of
<a href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/greatdivide.cfm">Great Divide Mountain Bike Route Maps</a> (I had been concerned that we
had only one set between the three of us), a new pump and some spare
inner&nbsp;tubes.</p>
<p>We finally got away from Whitefish at Midday and then stopped briefly in
Columbia Falls to pick up some supplies before heading on to the Swan
River. The locals at Columbia Falls seemed were very friendly and
interested in what we were doing – we even got a 10% discount at the&nbsp;supermarket!</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Junction before
Swan lake&#8221;]<img alt="Junction before Swan lake" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2505/3746005199_31459ca36f.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>After Swan River we were faced with another steep uphill climb and we
reached the summit at about 8pm. The mosquitoes were out and we made
swift progress down the hill to the Swan River National Wildlife Refuge.
From here we biked four miles off route to the campsite (and pub) at
Swan Lake where we spent the rest of the evening eating burgers and
entertaining the&nbsp;locals!</p>
<p><strong>Day 7: Swan Lake – Seeley Lake (88&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>We were slow to get moving the next morning but after a couple of free
cups of coffee at the post office we got moving towards our next
destination, Seeley Lake - almost 90 miles&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>Considering the terrain was mainly up-hill we made pretty good progress
during the day although I couldn’t understand why the boys seemed
insistent on eating all the lunch when we had at least another eight
hours of cycling to go? We had some differing philosophies here and I
much preferred to <em>‘graze’</em>on any food that I had during the day rather
than stop and eat it all at&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Marco Flitering
Water at Elk Creek, Montana&#8221;]<img alt="Marco Flitering Water at Elk Creek,
Montana" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2468/3746800752_a1a280e10d.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Anyway, at Clearwater Lake it was quite clear that we were all pretty
tired and we still had to get up and over Richmond Pass if we were going
to make our target of Seeley Lake for that evening. I was the last to
leave Clearwater Lake, having finished my lunch and filtered some water.
Then I started to make slow but steady progress up Richmond Pass. Simon
and Marco were waiting for me at the top of the pass and we had some
amazing views over the Mission Mountains Tribal Wilderness to the&nbsp;West.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Top of Richmond
Pass&#8221;]<img alt="Top of Richmond Pass" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2640/3746047053_dff57e7f30.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>The decent from Richmond was not easy. It was getting dark and on single
track. We had to constantly get on and off our bikes to negotiate
patches of snow and fallen trees. It seemed to take for ever for us to
get to the forestry road which was full of sand and didn’t really help
our&nbsp;progress.</p>
<p>We eventually got to Seeley Lake at 22.00h and everything was shut. We
made some pasta before falling quickly&nbsp;asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Day 8: Seeley Lake – Lincoln (64&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>My alarm went off at 7am and I got up. Simon didn’t seem keen to move,
so I left him in the tent and started to pack my stuff. I eventually
lured Marco out of his tent with the promise of breakfast and fresh
orange juice and we headed off to the café (in fact we got a lift!).
Simon joined us in the café and he was looking a little bit jaded but at
least he had stopped talking about giving&nbsp;up!</p>
<p>After breakfast we packed our stuff and although it was not getting late
we biked the 28 miles to the town of <a href="http://www.ovandomontana.net/">Ovando</a> where we had some of the
best sandwiches in the world for lunch at the <a href="http://www.ovandomontana.net/businesses/straybullet.php">Stray Bullet Cafe</a>.
Over lunch Simon decided to take the road to Lincoln in order to save a
bit of time and get some rest. For a while I considered joining him – I
was getting frustrated by the late starts in the morning and was
conscious that I would never make the route in 30 days unless we started
to pick up the pace a&nbsp;bit.</p>
<p>In the end Marco talked some sense into me and we both set off up and
over Huckleberry Pass before descending to join Simon in Lincoln. I
enjoyed Huckleberry Pass and although I was a lot slower than Marco
(<span class="caps">AKA</span>: The Mountain Goat) I felt fit really pleased to be taking part in
such a fantastic adventure through the&nbsp;states.</p>
<p>That evening in Lincoln we managed to find a laundry to wash out cycling
gear for the first time in over a week, a local bought us a pitcher of
beer and we decided that we would start getting up at 05.30h. A good
result all&nbsp;round!</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;The bar in
Lincoln&#8221;]<img alt="The bar in Lincoln" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2453/3746791014_7245833715.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Day 9: Lincoln – Helena (67&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>It was lucky we had the early start on day nine as the route the Helena
included three Continental Divide crossings. The first up Stemple Pass
was definitely the hardest and I found myself pushing my bike for the
majority of the way. There were also a number of stream crossing that
had to be done – which involved several near&nbsp;soakings!</p>
<p>After Stemple Pass we lost several thousand feet in height and then
started climbing again up towards the second divide crossing in the
Helena National Forest before loosing another thousand feet of height
and heading up towards the third divide crossing at Priest&nbsp;Pass.</p>
<p>From Priest Pass it was all downhill to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Montana">Helena</a> but it was important
that we also got to the Bike shop in Helena before it shut. Simon and
Marco needed to break pads for their back breaks and I had lost one of
my <span class="caps">SPD</span> clips which was making the cycling&nbsp;harder.</p>
<p>We raced to Helena and arrived at the <a href="http://greatdividecyclery.com/">Great Divide Cyclery</a> 30
minutes after it had shut! Looking at the map we found that there was
another bike shop (<a href="http://www.bigskybikes.com/">Big Sky Cyclery</a>) and we raced across the city to
try and get there. They were also shut – but the owner was still in the
shop and opened it up for us to buy what we needed. Unfortunately, they
didn’t have any break pads but I was able to buy my <span class="caps">SPD</span> clips and new
pair of cycling&nbsp;shoes.</p>
<p>That evening we treated ourselves to motel room and enjoyed some pasta
and Fat Tire beer at a local&nbsp;restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Day 10: Helena – Butte (67&nbsp;miles)</strong></p>
<p>Again we got a good start away from Helena of what was going to be a
mainly hot and uphill&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>The first part of the day went well and we made steady progress up the
steep gravel tracks and passed some interesting old kilns from Helena&#8217;s
industrial&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;375&#8221; caption=&#8221;Old kilns just
outside Helena&#8221;]<img alt="Old kilns just outside Helena" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2586/3746794926_c63b0de797.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>The middle part of the day was not do good! The description in the
guidebook said <strong><em>‘very steep’</em></strong>it was more like vertical! Simon and I
began the long and difficult push to the top. At the top we began the
long and difficult push to the bottom – it was far to steep to ride
(apart from for&nbsp;Marco!).</p>
<p>Eventually we made it to Basin and started a flatter section parallel to
the road and then along an old railway track (complete with a tunnel)
before the Elk Park Pass Continental Divide crossing and a flying decent
into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte,_Montana">Butte</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;375&#8221; caption=&#8221;Decent towards
Butte&#8221;]<img alt="Decent towards Butte" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2578/3746008637_b1e5c2561a.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte,_Montana">Butte</a> is a mining town famous for three things mining, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evel_Knievel">Evel
Knievel</a> (it was where he was born) and&nbsp;pasties!</p>
<p><strong>Day 11:</strong> <strong>Butte– Elkhorn Hot Springs&nbsp;Campground</strong></p>
<p>Today we split the team up. Simon and I headed off early while Marco
waited behind in Butte for the bike shop to open to see if he could pick
up the break pads that we needed. He would then catch us up&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>Simon and I made good progress and we were rewarded with beautiful views
of the Pioneer Mountains 25 miles into our morning&nbsp;ride.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3746070079_36b5c55f92.jpg" /></p>
<p>The decent on the other hand was another matter. The first ten miles
were fine but then due to maintenance on the gravel the last five miles
were just loose unpacked soil and sand. It was difficult to control the
bike and the trailer. Simon took a fall but luckily he wasn’t going that
fast and he just ended up with a few&nbsp;scrapes.</p>
<p>At Divide Creek Road we made the decision to take a recommended route
alternative rather than go up the northern shoulder of Mt. Fleecer and
across the Fleecer Ridge. If we had done this it would have just meant a
push up, over and down the other side. Instead the recommended
alternative took us on a beautiful route along the side of the Divide
Creek and then the Wise River to the town of Wise River. Here we stopped
to get something to eat and re-stock out supplies for the next couple of&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Again, we found ourselves checking Marco’s progress on the <span class="caps">SPOT</span> and when
we were confident that he had made it over the Fleecer Ridge we left a
note in the café and started the forty miles towards Elkhorn Hot&nbsp;Springs.</p>
<p>Despite being along the road the road to Elkhorn Hot Springs was hard –
particularly the last 10 miles up through Crystal Park. To make matters
worse if your speed dropped any less than seven miles per hour you were
devoured by a swarm of blood sucking mosquitoes! Simon, frustrated by
the swarm, ripped open his <span class="caps">BOB</span> bag in anger to cover himself in <span class="caps">DEET</span>
mosquito repellent. He shared some with me at out next stop – it was
strong stuff as it melted my bike gloves, the grips of my handlebars and
a hole in my cycle&nbsp;shorts!</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;375&#8221; caption=&#8221;The Wise River
on the road to Elkhorn Springs&#8221;]<img alt="The Wise River on the road to Elkhorn
Springs" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2488/3746784002_d2d86c4e1f.jpg" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Finally, after about 150 mosquito bites each we reached the turn off to
Elkhorn Hot Springs and as if by magic Marco caught up and we headed to
the restaurant for something to&nbsp;eat.</p>
<p>After a good meal and a number of laughs as we swapped stories from the
day we headed in the dark the two miles down the road to the campsite
where we quickly got the tents up and got some&nbsp;rest.</p>
<p><strong>In my next post in this series I will describe the route between
Elkhorn Springs Campground, Montana to the Sweetwater River,&nbsp;Wyoming.</strong></p>
